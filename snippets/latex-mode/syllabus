\\textbf{academic honesty:}
Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as your own.  Plagiarism/cheating will result in your forfeiting credit for the assignment that includes plagiarism and may result in your receiving an F for the course.  I expect every student to do their own work.  Any student turning in copied work (exams, homework, etc.), taking credit for anotherâ€™s work or ideas, or copying from the Internet will receive no points for that assignment.  All tests will be completed without the aid of the textbook or notes. Not following these rules will result in a zero on the exam.
