    * Note: see 'common R commands' link on course website. 
	
	* To submit 2.65a, start by writing down the equation
	for the least squares regression line. Find the value 
	for each term in that line using a command or series of
	commands in R and then fill the values computed by R
	into the line equation.  Explain what commands you used,
	for example you might write "To find the mean of Antho3, 
	I used the command:	mean(FILL_IN_THE_CORRECT_THING_HERE)". 
	As always, I encourage you to visit my office hours for further help.
