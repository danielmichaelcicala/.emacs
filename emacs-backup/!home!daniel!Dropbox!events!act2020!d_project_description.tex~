\section{Project Description}
\label{sec:project-description}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:motiv-object}

The grant proposal is to support the Applied Category Theory
2020 Adjoint School (``School'').  This comprises a
five-month long online reading course culminating in an
in-person research week to take place at the Massechusets
Institute of Technology from June 22--26, 2020.  

\subsubsection{Personnel}
\label{sec:personnel}

The participants of the School include three organizers
selected by the PI's, four senior researchers (``mentors'')
invited by the organizers, four junior researchers
(``TA's'') chosen by the mentors, and sixteen students
selected by the organizers through an open application process.

The primary roles of the PI's include the elucidation of
goals, knowledge management, and program evaluation. The
three organizers are Paolo Perrone of MIT, Carmen Constantin
of Oxford University, and Eliana Lorch of Oxford
University. Their roles include running the operations of
the School. The mentors include Michael Shulman of the
University of San Diego, Valeria de Paiva of Samsung
Research America, Michael Johnson of Maquari University, and
Robin Cockett of the Unversity of Calgary.  They are each
asked to develop a research problem and to lead a TA and
students through their chosen problem. Each mentors will
select their own TA whose background complements the
research problem.

The organizers will advertise a call for participation to
solicit applications from undergraduates, graduate students,
post-docs, and industry professionals. This call is to be
dispersed through several channels. First, through the
established networks of previous partipants, including the
blogs of John Baez, Tae-Denae Bradley, and Bartosz Mileski
whose combined readership eclipses 3.5 million views to
date. Second, the call will be targeted at attracting
underserved and underreprented populations through
advertising with groups such as the National Association of
Mathematicians, the Association for Women in Mathematics,
Spectra, the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and
Native Americans in the Sciences. A large pool of applicants
is expected because the 2018 School had 80 applications and
the 2019 School had 130 applications submitted.

The organizers form the selection committee to choose 16
students. The mentors and PI's provide feedback and support
to the selection committee. Our mission is to select a pool
of quality candidates that are diverse across socio-economic
dimensions, fields of practice, and academia versus
industry.

Once the students are selected, participants are divided
into four teams consisting of one mentor, one TA, and four students.

\subsubsection{Online Reading Course}
\label{sec:online-read-course}

\emph{Please note that funding is not required for this portion of
  the school.}

From February to June 2020 the format of the School is an
online reading seminar. This follows the model of Emily
Riehl’s Kan Extension Seminar \cite{riehlkan}. The objective of
this portion of the School is to provide the students with
the background needed to participate in their research project.

The content of online reading seminar derives from each
mentor selecting two papers relating to their project. A two
week block is devoted to each of these eight total papers.  During
each block, two students serve as leaders and are supported by
the TA. Each block will have three phases.
\begin{itemize}
\item A presentation by the two student leaders of the
  assigned paper using Zoom, an online video conference
  system. The student leaders then field questions from
  other students.
\item All students give a reading response on a private
  forum. The associated TA serves as a domain expert and
  facilitates discussion. 
\item The student leaders publish an article summarizing the
  assigned paper on the well-known mathematics blog The
  n-Category Caf\'e.
\end{itemize}

One block will follow another until all papers are exhausted
upon which time the reading course portion is complete.  The
in-person research week follows.

\subsubsection{In-person Research Week}
\label{sec:person-research-week}

\emph{Please note, this is the portion of the School to be
  supported with grant funds.}

From June 22--26, 2020, the Massachusets Institute of
Technology will host a 7-day research school. This is
attended by the PI's, organizers, mentors, TAs, and
students.  This week commences with opening lectures by the
mentors devoted to outlining their research goals. The
remaining time is fully devoted to collaborative
research. During the day, each team directs its research as
they see fit. In the early evening, all participants convene
to watch a student representative from each team give a ten
minute progress report.

While the School does not require that each team begin
research prior to the in-person week, the School does
encourage it. 

\subsubsection{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:research-objectives}

The following research objectives are given by the mentors. \\

\textbf{Michael Shulman} \\

Title: \emph{Practical type theories for symmetric monoidal
  bicategories}

Type theories are formal systems allowing us to reason about
categorical structures by "treating their objects as if they
were sets" in a formal sense.  While type theories for
cartesian categorical structures are better-known, there are
also "linear" type theories for non-cartesian structures.
In this project we aim to construct a convenient type theory
for reasoning about symmetric monoidal bicategories, which
can be used to model many different kinds of open and
interconnected systems.  We will build on recent results
establishing a similar type theory for symmetric monoidal
categories as well as coherence theorems for symmetric
monoidal bicategories. \\

\textbf{Valeria de Paiva} \\

I would like to investigate the connections between the
various manifestations of lenses in Computer Science, in
particular the connections to Dialectica Categories as
described in \cite{paiva_dialect}. The notion of a lens
finds use in computer science as a way to encode
bidirectional transformations, where one has a “get” func-
tion that connects an input to its corresponding output, and
a “put” function which updates the input given an
input/output pair. These two functions must interact in
sensible ways. These functions are very reminiscent of the
Dialectica morphisms in \cite{paiva_dialect}.

The abstract structure of lenses has been recently noticed
across surprisingly many applications of category theory,
such as in (but not limited to) the work of Fong, Spivak,
and Tuyeras as on a compositional model of backpropagation
in supervised learning \cite{backprop} and in the work of
Budiu, Galenson, and Plotkin on partial compilers
\cite{partial_comp}. It is expected that there is a
connection between the Dialectica construction and the work
on partial compilers, but the details currently remain
mysterious.

  projects here}

\subsubsection{Mentoring and Education Objectives}
\label{sec:education-objectives}

An important consideration for the School is to bring young
researchers together with experts in the field of Applied
Category Theory.

An objective around the TA's are to improve their skill in
leading research and working with students.  The TA's, who
shall be a graduate student, post-doc, or junior industry
professional, will co-lead a research project. With the
assistance of their menntor, TA's must bring their students
to a required level of sophistication. This is excellent
practice for TA's seeking to one day have graduate
students. Moreover, during the in-person research week, the
TA's collaborate with the mentor to decide on what questions
to pursue. After the end of the school, the TA will lead the
process of writing the results.

One objective for students is that they remain in the field
of applied category theory. We hope student continue to
collaborate with TA's and mentors as well as form
collaboration amoungst themselves. Beyond networking
opportunities, the School provides the students with
practice in reading and presenting research papers, writing
expository articles, pursuing a research project,
collaborating with others in research, discussing research
level topics in a casual way, writing journal articles, and
giving conference presentations (see Section \ref{sec:related-work}). 

\subsubsection{Evaluation Plan}
\label{sec:evaluation-plan}

To evaluate the diversity of our applicant pool, we will
collect diversity statistics (annonymously) from applicants
and correlate diversity with where an applicant learned about
the School. Future iterations of the school will use this
data to more precisely target underrepresented applicants.

To evaluate the success of our students, we will conduct
process and outcome evalation activites through surveys
offered just prior to the beginning of the School,
immediately after the completion of the School, and one year
after the completion of the school. These surveys will be
designed to collect qualitative and quantiative data on a
number of dimensions, such as those enumerated in Section
\ref{sec:education-objectives}. This data will be used by
future organizers to design the School with futher
consideration to promote desired objectives.

\subsubsection{Related Events}
\label{sec:related-work}

From June 29 to July 3, the week directly following the
School, MIT is hosting the third annual conference/workshop
in Applied Category Theory. An estimated 150 attendees will
attend from across the world, including academics, industry
professionals, and students. This event is formatted so that
half of the time is devoted to research talks and the other
half is devoted to structured discussion around recent
developments in applied category theory. Students from the
School will present on their work at the
conference/workshop. \emph{Note that no grant funds for the
  school are to be used for the conference/workshop.}

Two iterations of the School ran in 2018 and 2019.  No NSF
funding was obtained for those events. The 2020 School is
run in a similar way to previous Schools.

Applied category theory is a new field where researchers use
the tools of category theory in applied areas such as
science and engineering.

A category consists of a collection of objects together with
a collection of maps between those objects, satisfying
certain rules. Mathematicians use maps between categories to
turn problems in one subject into easier problems in another
subject \cite{riehl}. An example from pure math: topological
invariants, like homology, are usually maps between
categories. In computer science, maps between categories are
used to connect syntax and semantics: thus, they clarify the
relation between programs and what programs actually do
\cite{crole, pierce}. In quantum physics, maps between
categories connect abstract theories and their concrete
implementations in terms of operators between Hilbert
spaces. The applied category theory community is extending
this paradigm to other fields of science and engineering
\cite{spivak14}. This allows developments in one such field
to be transferred to another field through category theory.

Other recent work in this field include:
\begin{itemize}
    %\item operational semantics \cite{crole, gplot, ghica}
\item modeling open and interconnected systems --- Baez,
  Fong, Pollard, Spivak \emph{et.\ al.\ } \cite{baez15,
    baezfongpollard, baezpollard, 7sketches}
\item resource theories --- Coecke, Fritz, Spekkens
  \textsl{et.\ al.} \cite{coecke1, fritz1, fritz2}.
\item rewriting --- Gadducci, Lack, Sobonci\'nski \textsl{et.\ al.} \cite{gadd, adhesive}
\item computability theory --- Cockett, Hofstra, Pavlovic,
  \\textsl{et.\ al.} \cite{hofstra, hofstra2, pavlovic}
\item database theory --- Breiner, Johnson, Spivak,
  Subrahmanian \textsl{et.\ al.} \cite{spivak17, johnson}
\item compositional approaches to cognition and linguistics
  --- Coecke, Lewis, Sadrzadeh \textsl{et.\ al.}
  \cite{sadrzadeh, lewis, lewis2}
\item category theory in functional programming ---
  Milewski, Wadler \textsl{et.\ al.} \cite{barr, bart, wadler}
\item distributed systems --- Spivak, Vagner \textsl{et.\ al.}
  \cite{spivak16, vagner}
\item game theory --- Ghani, Hedges, Shprits, Winschel, Zahn
  \textsl{et.\ al.} \cite{jules13, jules16}
\end{itemize} 
The School intends to continue increasing applied category
theory knowledge.  

A grand ambition of applied category theory is that it can
offer a sort of Rosetta Stone across disciplines. However, it
is unreasonable to expect, say, research biologists to learn
category theory.  A more realistic approach is to develop
category theory informed software that can our biologist can
use to describe biological systems.  Through this software,
knowledge about the structure of biological systems can be
used to reason about systems with analgous structure from
other fields. To create such a software product, one needs
talented programmers working in applied category
theory. Increasing the number of programmers is a goal of
the School. Also needed is the correct language to translate
catgory theory into computer code. One candidate for such a
language is \emph{type theory}.

There is already a well-developed correspondence between
certain kinds of categories and type theories. However,
these kinds of categories do not include those that appear
most frequently in applied category theory.  Mike Shulman's
research project on type theory aims to extend the
correspondence to the sorts of categories that applied
category theorists do care about, that is \emph{non-cartesian
  monoidal categories}. Finding a type theory to correspond
to non-cartesian monoidal categories would be a big step in
translating the category theory to software.

As described above, category theory is well-adapted at
morphing a problem in one area into an easier problem in
another.  This works by identifying some underlying,
relevant structure to be preserved under morphing while
irrelevant structure is cast away. Thus, an important aspect
of category theory is about finding structures essential to
the objects of study. Exciting discoveries come when one
finds a single structure in disparate locations. One such
structure that is currently undergoing scrutiny for its
repeated appearances in, seemingly, unrelated places is
called a \emph{lens}, which originated in database theory. A
lens, a pair of functions subject to sensible interaction
laws, encodes how relational databases are viewed and
updated. Eventually category theorists captured their
essence and wrote a definition in categorical terms. During
the Applied Category Theory 2019 Conference, the abstract
structure of a lens was found to pervade unexpected
territories such as functional programming, game theory in
economics, backpropigation in machine learning, and
more. Each area is now a current line of research.  Valeria
de Paiva's research project (see Section
\ref{sec:research-objectives}) seeks to futher understand
lenses.

\subsection{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:broader-impacts}

The broader impacts of the School are many.  Given that
applied category theory is an emerging field, this School may
have a large impact on its future make-up.

% and underrepresented minorities in science, technology,
% engineering, and mathematics (STEM);

\subsubsection{Diversity and Inclusion}
\label{sec:diversity-inclusion}

The School can positively impact the representation of
diverse groups and their inclusion across multiple
dimensions. The call for participation to students will be
advertised with as National Association of Mathematicians,
the Association for Women in Mathematics, Spectra, the
Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans
in the Sciences. Also, the School has within its networks
Drs.\ Eugenia Cheng and Emily Riehl, both of who are active
in the intersection of math and diversity.  Because the
School is not only for mathematicians, but also programmers
and scientists, there is a large pool of applicants.

\daniel{find more organizations to apply to. Ask Emily
  Pillmore about computing.}

Beyond simply providing an opportunity for the students of
the School to do research, we are broadening their
networks. During the School, they will work with an expert
in applied category theory. The week after the School,
during the workshop/conference, students are given a
platform to present their work to experts from both academia
and industry.

To measure diversity and inclusion, a survey will be
administered. This survey will ask each applicant to supply
information about their socio-economic background and also
where they first learned about the School.  Those
advertising streams that correlate well with diverse
applicants can be used to better effect in future School's.

\subsubsection{Academia and Industry}
\label{sec:academia-industry}

A fundemental aspect of applied category theory is the idea
of an abstract system. Thus, applied category theory is
relevant to any field interestedin systems. For example,
biology studies ecological systems. Sociologists study
social systems or political systems.  Engineer design
systems. Systems appear in academia and industry. Therefore,
participation between academia and industry is central to
the success of applied category theory as a field.
Fostering this participation is a key component of the
School. After evaluating the 2019 School, the PI found that
industry professionals were not clear as to whether they
were allowed to apply to be students. For the 2020 School,
all advertisements will make it completely unambiguous that
industry professionals are encouraged to apply and that part
of our mission is to mix industry and academic
students. The proportion of industry representatives among
the applicants can be evaluated by survey.  

Currently, applied category theory informs work at a number
of US companies and institutes.
\begin{itemize}
\item Metron Scientific Solutions uses operads in their
  project with DARPA to build a Complex Adaptive System
  Composition and Design Environment.
\item Pyrofex uses enriched categories in their design of a
  proprietary cryptocurrency .
\item Categorical Informatics uses category theory to design
  databases.
\item Siemens, especially Arquimedes Canedo.
\item NIST, especially Spencer Breiner and Eswaran
  Subramanian.
\item RChain, especially Greg Meredith.
\end{itemize}
Most of these organizations send representatives to the
conference/workshop that follows the School, meaning that
the students will be presenting their work to industry
professionals.

The potential of this subject in industry has just begun to
be exploited. The School will work to accelerate the
industrial adaption of applied category theory. Junior
researchers will learn how to apply category theory. The
School exposes participants from industry to the uses of
this subject. Then the conference/workshop following the
school fosters networking between the students and
professionals, particularly by providing the students with
an opportunity to present their work.

The success of the School to strengthen networks will be
evaluated using follow-up surveys.  

\subsection{Results from Prior NSF Support}
\label{sec:results-from-prior}

The PI's have no prior NSF support.  

\subsection{Unfunded Collaborations}

The School will collaborate with Dr.~David Spivak of
MIT. This is discussed further in the Facilities, Equipment,
and Other Resources section. 

\subsection{Proposals for Renewed Support}
\label{sec:prop-renew-supp}

This is not a proposal for renewed support.
