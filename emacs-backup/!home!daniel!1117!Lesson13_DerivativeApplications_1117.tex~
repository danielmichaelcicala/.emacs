\textbf{Lesson 12: Trig Derivatives}

\textit{I designed these lecture notes specifically to direct my lectures and so they may be incomplete, contain typos or errors, and I may deviate from these notes in class. I did not design these notes for students, though I do believe they may serve to help students follow along in class. As such, they are not meant to replace your personal notes, merely to supplement them. ---Daniel Cicala  }
