Off the top of my head, perhaps a stats course for a local non-profit who relies on grant money and needs to report their impact to funders but may not have in-house capacity to do descriptive statistics.  This could be good for students interested in community psychology.  Again, this is me thinking on the spot, but helpful support might include (i) finding and liaisoning with agencies (ii) teaching release for a first iteration of the class for time to organize such a course, (iii) support in the psychology department to find interested students.
