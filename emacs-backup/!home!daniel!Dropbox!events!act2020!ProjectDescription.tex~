\section*{Overview}
\label{sec:motiv-object}

The grant proposal is to support the Applied Category Theory
2020 Adjoint School (``School'').  This comprises a
five-month long online reading course culminating in an
in-person research week to take place at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology from June 22--26, 2020.  

\section*{Motivation}

Applied category theory (``ACT'') is a new field where researchers use
the tools of category theory in applied areas such as
science and engineering. 

A category consists of a collection of objects together with
a collection of maps between those objects, satisfying
certain rules. Mathematicians use maps between categories to
turn problems in one subject into easier problems in another
subject [Rei17]. An example from pure math: topological
invariants, like homology, are usually maps between
categories. In computer science, maps between categories are
used to connect syntax and semantics: thus, they clarify the
relation between programs and what programs actually do
[Cor93,PBP91]. In quantum physics, maps between categories connect
abstract theories and their concrete implementations in
terms of operators between Hilbert spaces. The applied
category theory community is extending this paradigm to
other fields of science and engineering [Spi14]. This allows
developments in one such field to be transferred to another
field through category theory.

The breadth of applications can be seen through recent work
in ACT:
\begin{itemize}
\item modeling open and interconnected systems --- Baez,
  Fong, Pollard, Spivak \emph{et.\ al.\ } [BF15, BFP16,
  BP17, FS18]
\item resource theories --- Coecke, Fritz, Spekkens
  \textsl{et.\ al.} [CFS16, Fri17]
\item rewriting --- Gadducci, Lack, Sobonci\'nski
  \textsl{et.\ al.} [Cic19, GH97, LS04]
\item computability theory --- Cockett, Hofstra, Pavlovic,
  \textsl{et.\ al.} [CHO08. CH10, Pav13]
\item database theory --- Breiner, Johnson, Spivak,
  Subrahmanian \textsl{et.\ al.} [FS18, JRW12] 
\item compositional approaches to cognition and linguistics
  --- Coecke, Lewis, Sadrzadeh \textsl{et.\ al.} [CSC10,
  LL14, LL16]
\item category theory in functional programming ---
  Milewski, Wadler \textsl{et.\ al.} [BW90, Mil18, Wad92]
\item distributed systems --- Spivak, Vagner \textsl{et.\
    al.} [SSV16,VSL15]
\item game theory --- Ghani, Hedges, Shprits, Winschel, Zahn
  \textsl{et.\ al.} [Gha+18, Hed+16] 
\end{itemize}

Through the School, we hope to increase the ACT community
infrastructure by strengthening professional networks and
attracting talented students.

\section*{School Description}

This section contains a list of the personnel who will
participate in the School, a description of the online
reading course, and a description of the in-person visit to
MIT.

% =============================================

\subsection*{Personnel}
\label{sec:personnel}

The participants of the School include
\begin{itemize}
\item three PI's
\item three organizers selected by the PI's, 
\item four senior researchers (``mentors'') invited by the
  organizers, 
\item four junior researchers (``TA's'') chosen by the
  mentors, and 
\item sixteen students selected by the organizers through an
  open application process.
\end{itemize}

The primary roles of the PI's include the elucidation of
goals, knowledge management, and program evaluation.

The three organizers are Paolo Perrone of MIT, Carmen
Constantin of Oxford University, and Eliana Lorch of Oxford
University. Their roles include running the operations of
the School.

The mentors include Michael Shulman of the University of San
Diego, Valeria de Paiva of Samsung Research America, Michael
Johnson of Macquarie University, and \daniel{insert last
  mentor here}.  They will each develop a research problem
and a choose a TA with an appropriate background. Mentors
then lead, with the help of their TA, four students to
through their chosen problem.

The students are chosen through an open application process
available to all undergraduates, graduate students, and
junior-level industry professionals.  The call for applications
will be dispersed through several channels. First, through
the established networks of previous participants, including
the blogs of John Baez, Tae-Denae Bradley, and Bartosz
Mileski whose combined readership eclipses 3.5 million views
to date. Second, the call will be targeted at attracting
underserved and underrepresented populations through
advertising with groups such as the National Association of
Mathematicians, the Association for Women in Mathematics,
Spectra, the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and
Native Americans in the Sciences. A large pool of applicants
is expected because the 2018 School had 80 applications and
the 2019 School had 130 applications submitted.  The
organizers form the selection committee to choose 16
students. The mentors and PI's will provide feedback and
support to the selection committee. Our mission is to select
a pool of quality candidates that are diverse across
socio-economic dimensions, fields of practice, and academia
versus industry.

Once the students are selected, participants are divided
into four teams consisting of one mentor, one TA, and four students.

% ======================================

\subsection*{Online Reading Course}

\emph{Please note that funding is not required for this portion of
  the school.}

From February to June 2020 the format of the School is an
online reading seminar. This follows the model of Emily
Riehl’s Kan Extension Seminar [Rie17]. The objective of
this portion of the School is to provide the students with
the background needed to participate in their research project.

The content of online reading seminar is chosen by the
mentors each selecting two papers that relate to their
project. To each of these eight total papers, a two week
block of time is devoted during which two students serve as
leaders. Each block will have three phases.
\begin{itemize}
\item A presentation by the two student leaders of the
  assigned paper using Zoom, an online video conference
  system. The student leaders then field questions from
  other students.
\item All students give a reading response on a private
  forum. The associated TA serves as a domain expert and
  facilitates discussion. 
\item The student leaders publish an article summarizing the
  assigned paper on the well-known mathematics blog The
  n-Category Caf\'e.
\end{itemize}

One block will follow another until all papers are exhausted
upon which time the reading course portion is complete.  The
in-person research week follows.

% =======================================

\subsection*{In-person Research Week}

\emph{Please note, this is the only portion of the School to
  be supported with grant funds.}

From June 22--26, 2020, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology will host a 7-day research school. This is
attended by the PI's, organizers, mentors, TA's, and
students.  This week commences with opening lectures by the
mentors for outlining their research goals. The
remaining time is fully devoted to collaborative
research. During the day, each team directs its research as
they see fit. In the early evening, all participants convene
to watch a student representative from each team give a ten
minute progress report.

While the School does not require that each team begin
research prior to the in-person week, the School does
encourage it. 

% ===========================================
% ===========================================

\section*{Research Objectives}

The following research objectives are given by the mentors. \\

\subsection*{Michael Shulman---Practical type theories for symmetric monoidal
  bicategories}

Type theories are formal systems allowing us to reason about
categorical structures by "treating their objects as if they
were sets" in a formal sense.  While type theories for
Cartesian categorical structures are better-known, there are
also "linear" type theories for non-Cartesian structures.
In this project we aim to construct a convenient type theory
for reasoning about symmetric monoidal bicategories, which
can be used to model many different kinds of open and
interconnected systems.  We will build on recent results
establishing a similar type theory for symmetric monoidal
categories as well as coherence theorems for symmetric
monoidal bicategories. \\

\subsection*{Valeria de Paiva---Lenses and Dialectica Categories}

I would like to investigate the connections between the
various manifestations of lenses in Computer Science, in
particular the connections to Dialectica Categories as
described in [Pai89]. The notion of a lens
finds use in computer science as a way to encode
bidirectional transformations, where one has a “get” func-
tion that connects an input to its corresponding output, and
a “put” function which updates the input given an
input/output pair. These two functions must interact in
sensible ways. These functions are very reminiscent of the
Dialectica morphisms in [Pai89].

The abstract structure of lenses has been recently noticed
across surprisingly many applications of category theory,
such as in (but not limited to) the work of Fong, Spivak,
and Tuyeras as on a compositional model of backpropagation
in supervised learning [FST19] and in the work of Budiu,
Galenson, and Plotkin on partial compilers [BGP13]. It is
expected that there is a connection between the Dialectica
construction and the work on partial compilers, but the
details currently remain mysterious.

\subsection*{Daniel Cicala---Compositional network theory}

The aim of this project is to introduce the idea of
compositionality to the field of network theory.

Compositionality is a driving philosophy across applied
category theory. Compositionality holds when a system's
behavior is determined by its constituent parts. Examples
are found across disciplines, such as electrical engineering
(electrical circuits), linguistics (sentences), biology
(regulatory gene networks), computer science (computer
programs), etc.

Network theory is a field of applied mathematics that uses
graphs to study relationships (edges) between discrete
objects (nodes).  Applications include electrical
engineering (circuit diagrams), biology (gene networks),
social science (interpersonal relationships), finance
(interdependence of financial institutions). A practitioner
can model network of interest with a graph and infer
properties of the former using the properties of the latter.

Many networks of interest are large and complex. Consider
the network (graph) formed by friendships on Facebook by
associating a node to each account and an edge between nodes
whenever the corresponding accounts are friends.  As of
September 2019, Facebook reported in its publicly
available Q3 2019 Earnings Release that there are 2.45
billion active monthly users. This corresponds to a large
graph. The success of this project will provide easier
methods to study such large graphs.

Compositional networks were formalized as decorated cospans
by Fong [Fon15] and later as structured cospans by Baez and
Courser [BC19]. Cicala expanded on the latter by introducing a
theory of rewriting to structured cospans [Cic19]. The common
theme to both formalisms is that networks are encoded as
morphisms in a category, hence highlighting the
compositional structure. The structured cospan formalism is
compatible with many flavors of graphs so is a suitable
vehicle to introduce compositionality to network theory.

A primary goal for this project is to generalize graph graph
measures, particularly those used for centrality and
closeness, from networks to structured cospans. In addition,
we will apply such measures to a social network used to
study the spread of obesity [CF07].

\subsection*{Michael Johnson---Maintainable Relations}

Relations have many important applications, and
correspondingly the category theoretic study of relations is
well-developed. Typically, relations from $X$ to $Y$ are defined
as subobjects of the product of $X$ and $Y$, and if $X$ and $Y$ are
objects in a regular category $C$ then we can construct a
bicategory $\textup{rel}(C)$ whose morphisms are relations in $C$.
Conversely bicategories that arise as such a $\textup{rel}(C)$ were
studied in a recent ACT School which examined the seminal
paper \emph{Cartesian Bicategories I} by Carboni and Walters
[CW87].

In this project we study (bi)categories of maintainable
relations between categories.  In this situation, the $X$ and
$Y$ of the last paragraph, will be categories, and $C$ will be
$\textup{Cat}$, the category of (small) categories. $\textup{Cat}$ is not a
regular category, so we need to take an alternative approach
to relations that uses equivalence classes of spans in $C$.
Maintainable relations, which are instances of bidirectional
transformations (cf.\ lenses), are relations $R$ between
categories $X$ and $Y$ with extra structure so that if objects $x$
of $X$ and $y$ of $Y$ are $R$-related by a specific witness $r$, and
if $f\colon x \to x'$ is an arrow of $X$, then the extra structure
gives (functorially) an arrow $g\colon y \to y'$ such that $x'$ and
$y'$ are again $R$-related, and by a specific witness $r'$ (cf.\
symmetric delta lenses).  Commonly in applications the
relation $R$ is called a "consistency relation" and the extra
structure is called "consistency restoration" (or in lens
terms, change propagation).

\section*{Mentoring and Education Objectives}
\label{sec:education-objectives}

An important consideration for the School is to bring young
researchers together with experts in the field of Applied
Category Theory.

An objective around the TA's is to improve their skill in
leading research and working with students.  The TA's, who
shall be a graduate student, post-doc, or junior industry
professional, will co-lead a research project. With the
assistance of their mentor, TA's must bring their students
to a required level of sophistication. This is excellent
practice for TA's seeking to one day have graduate
students. Moreover, during the in-person research week, the
TA's collaborate with the mentor to decide on what questions
to pursue. After the end of the school, the TA will lead the
process of writing the results.

One objective for students is that they remain in the field
of applied category theory. We encourage teams to continue their
collaboration with TA's and mentors as well as form
collaboration among themselves. Beyond networking
opportunities, the School provides the students with
practice in reading and presenting research papers, writing
expository articles, pursuing a research project,
collaborating with others in research, discussing research
level topics in a casual way, writing journal articles, and
giving conference presentations.

% ================================================
% ================================================

\section*{Evaluation Plan}

To evaluate the diversity of our applicant pool, we will
collect diversity statistics (anonymously) from applicants
and correlate diversity with where an applicant learned about
the School. Future iterations of the school will use this
data to more precisely target underrepresented applicants.

To evaluate the success of our students, we will conduct
process and outcome evaluation activities through surveys
offered prior to the beginning of the School,
immediately after the completion of the School, and one year
after the completion of the school. These surveys will be
designed to collect qualitative and quantitative data related
to the educational objectives outlined above. This data will
be used by future School organizers.

% ================================================
% ================================================

\section*{Related Events}

From June 29 to July 3, the week directly following the
School, MIT is hosting the third annual conference/workshop
in Applied Category Theory. An estimated 150 attendees will
attend from across the world, including academics, industry
professionals, and students. This event is formatted so that
half of the time is devoted to research talks and the other
half is devoted to structured discussion around recent
developments in applied category theory. Students from the
School will present on their work at the
conference/workshop. \emph{Note that no grant funds for the
  school are to be used for the conference/workshop.}

Two iterations of the School ran in 2018 and 2019.  No NSF
funding was obtained for those events. The 2020 School is
run in a similar way to previous Schools.

Category theory has long been a powerful tool for
transferring techniques between disciplines in pure
mathematics. The rise of Applied Category Theory comes with
the usefulness of categorical methods in disciplines ranging
from biochemistry, electrical engineering and control theory
to the study of stochastic processes, the design of
databases, and the design of networks of mobile
agents. Operads, sheaves and other sophisticated concepts
are not only giving rise to new methodologies for system
design and analysis, but also triggering new developments in
the underlying mathematics. The School brings young minds
from diverse backgrounds to this emerging field to work on
research proposed by leading experts.

Michael Shulman is a leading expert on the relationship between
categories and type theories.  He is a pioneer in the field
of homotopy type theory [Pro13] where the interplay
between categories and types is central. Mike Shulman is
also experienced in leading such extracurricular activities
having taught at a summer school on categorical logic and
organized and lead a team of junior researchers at a
Mathematical Research Community run by the AMS. 

Prof.~Shulman's project lends itself to one grand ambition
of applied category theory: to be a Rosetta Stone across
disciplines. However, it is unreasonable to expect, say,
research biologists to learn category theory.  A more
realistic approach is to develop category theory informed
software that can our biologist can use to encode biological
systems.  Through this software, knowledge about the
structure of biological systems can be used to reason about
systems with analogous structure from other fields. To create
such a software product, one needs talented programmers
working in applied category theory. Increasing the number of
programmers in ACT is one goal of the School. Also needed is
the correct language to translate category theory into
computer code. One candidate for such a language is
\emph{type theory}. There is already a well-developed
correspondence between certain kinds of categories and type
theories. However, these kinds of categories do not include
those that appear most frequently in applied category
theory. This research project on type theory aims to extend
the correspondence to the sorts of categories that applied
category theorists do care about, that is
\emph{non-Cartesian monoidal categories}. Finding a type
theory to correspond to non-Cartesian monoidal categories
would be a big step in translating the category theory to
software.

Valeria de Paiva earned her doctorate under Martin Hyland, a
preeminent scholar in category theory.  Dr.~de Paiva has
since worked in industry, working as a Senior Research
Scientist for various Silicon Valley enterprises.  Having
led research projects through industry, she is well suited
to leading a team of junior researchers while endowing them
with the many soft skills needed in collaborative
research. She also champions women in mathematics, which
matches with the ethos of the broader ACT community.

Dr.~de Paiva's project is about illuminating the abstract
structure of a ``lens'', which has been independently
discovered in unexpected places. As described above,
category theory is well-adapted at morphing a problem in one
area into an easier problem in another.  This works by
identifying some underlying, relevant structure to be
preserved under morphing while irrelevant structure is cast
away. Thus, an important aspect of category theory is about
finding structures essential to the objects of
study. Exciting discoveries come when one finds a single
structure in disparate locations. Indeed, the abstract
structure of a lens is currently being studied for its
repeated appearances in, seemingly, unrelated places. Lenses
originated in database theory as a pair of functions,
subject to sensible interaction laws, that encode how
relational databases are viewed and updated. Eventually
category theorists captured their essence and wrote a
definition in categorical terms. During the Applied Category
Theory 2019 Conference, the abstract structure of a lens was
found in places such as functional programming, economic
game theory, and backpropagation from machine learning, to
name a few. Each area is now a current line of research.
Valeria de Paiva's research project seeks to further understand
lenses.

Daniel Cicala is an expert in structured cospans and their
rewriting. He recently received his Ph.D.\ under the
direction of John Baez, a pioneer in applied category
theory. Dr.~Cicala's project grows out of Prof.\ Baez's
research program. 

Dr.~Cicala's project is central to the many applications of
network theory. Because network theory is largely driven by
the analyzing of particular networks, the development of its
theory has been stagnant.  By introducing compositionality
to this field and developing the resulting theory, we hope
to provide new computational tools to study
networks. Specifically, compositionality will allow
computing on subnetworks, hence requiring less computational
power.  The theory of structured cospans will then provide a
formalism to aggregate the information gleaned from
subnetworks of a particular network to provide information
about entire network. Applications can be found in all areas
where large networks are studied.

Michael Johnson has been Professor of Mathematics and
Computer Science at Macquarie University since 2002. He was
Foundation Director of the Macquarie-DEC ICT Innovations
Centre (2002-2012) and Founding Scientific Director of the
Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub. Michael is a
longstanding Fellow of the Australian Mathematical Society,
a Fellow and Certified Professional of the Australian
Computer Society, and a life member of the American
Mathematical Society.  More recently he has been elected as
a Fellow of the Governance Institute of Australia. He a
world leading expert in bidirectional transformations.

Prof.\ Johnson's project is in a a rich area with many
interesting interactions involving bicategories of spans,
lenses (both symmetric and asymmetric), fibrations and
generalisations of fibred category theory, as well as direct
(and motivating) applications in database design and system
interoperation and even machine learning.  It is a mix of
interesting theoretical questions and concrete applications.
We will attack open questions involving exactness properties
of categories of maintainable relations, we will seek to
understand the interactions with classical work such as that
of Carboni and Walters, and we will develop concrete
examples of system interactions that are modelled by
maintainable relations.

\section*{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:broader-impacts}

There are many broader impacts of the School.  Given that
ACT is an emerging field, this School can have a large
impact on the field's future make-up.

% and underrepresented minorities in science, technology,
% engineering, and mathematics (STEM);

\subsection*{Diversity and Inclusion}
\label{sec:diversity-inclusion}

The School can positively impact the representation of
diverse groups and their inclusion across multiple
dimensions. The call for participation to students will be
advertised with as National Association of Mathematicians,
the Association for Women in Mathematics, Spectra, the
Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans
in the Sciences. Because the School is not only for
mathematicians, but also programmers and scientists, there
is a large pool of potential applicants from which we can
increase diversity.  

Beyond simply providing an opportunity for the students of
the School to do research, we are broadening and
strengthening their networks. During the School, they will
work with an expert in applied category theory. The week
after the School, during the conference, students are given
a platform to present their work to experts from both
academia and industry. Students will also join working
groups with these same experts as part of the structured
conversation portion of the conference.

To measure diversity and inclusion, a survey will be
administered. This survey will ask each applicant to supply
information about their socio-economic background and also
where they first learned about the School.  Those
advertising streams that correlate well with diverse
applicants can be used to better effect in future School's.

\subsection*{Academia and Industry}
\label{sec:academia-industry}

A fundamental aspect of applied category theory is the idea
of an abstract system. Thus, applied category theory is
potentially relevant to any field interested in systems. For
example, biology studies ecological systems. Sociologists
study social systems or political systems.  Engineers design
mechanical or electrical systems. Such systems appear across
academia and industry. Therefore, participation between
academia and industry is central to the success of applied
category theory as a field.  Fostering this participation is
a key component of the School. After evaluating the 2019
School, the PI found that industry professionals were not
clear as to whether they were allowed to apply to be
students. For the 2020 School, all advertisements will
unambiguously encourage industry professionals to apply. The
proportion of industry representatives among the applicants
will be evaluated by collecting data from the application
materials.

The importance of industry is not hypothetical.  Currently,
applied category theory informs work at a number of US
companies and institutes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Metron Scientific Solutions use operads in their
  project with DARPA to build a Complex Adaptive System
  Composition and Design Environment;
\item Pyrofex uses enriched categories in their design of a
  proprietary cryptocurrency;
\item Categorical Informatics uses category theory to design
  databases;
\item Siemens engineer Arquimedes Canedo uses applied
  category theory;
\item National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
  scientists Spencer Breiner, Eswaran Subramanian, and
  post-doc Blake Pollard apply category theory to designing
  power grids;
\item RChain founder Greg Meredith applied category theory
  to software design.
\end{itemize}
Most of these organizations send representatives to the
conference/workshop that follows the School, meaning that
the students will be presenting their work to industry
professionals.

The potential of this subject in industry has just begun to
be exploited. The School works to accelerate the industrial
adaption of applied category theory. The School exposes
participants from industry to the uses of this subject. Then
the conference following the School builds networks between
the students and professionals, particularly by providing
the students with an opportunity to present their work.

The success of the School to strengthen networks will be
evaluated using formative and summative evaluation survey
questions.
