\textbf{Lecture 08---Intro to Derivatives}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In the real world, functions often describe a quantity that changes in time.  For example
\begin{itemize}
\item position of a planet
\item population of a species
\item economic indicators
\item revenues for a business
\item efficiency of an engine
\end{itemize}

When dealing with functions that describe such real world scenarios, an important question to ask is how the function changes in time. For example
\begin{itemize}
\item How fast is the planet moving and in which direction
\item Is the population of a species increasing or descreasing and how fast
\item Is the GDP growing or shrinking
\item Are revenues inceasing or decreasing?
\item Is the engine becoming more efficient or less?
\end{itemize}

The mathematical tool used to answer these questions is the derivative.  In this section, we introduce the idea of the derivative and how to define it for any given function.

\section{Derivatives in Pictures}
\label{sec:derivatives-pictures}

\begin{notes}
  
\item[Recall limits] 
  In the beginning of the limits section, we said that the main reason to define limits is so that we can define the tangent line to a function.  The slope of the tangent line is way that we measure how a function is changing at its point of contact, hence the derivative.  Recall how it works.

  \textbf{see Desmos 08-01}
  
\item[Problem solved]
  To define the tangent line to $f$ at $p$...
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Start w a secant line through points $p=(x_p,f(x_p))$ and
    $q=(x,f(x))$
  \item Let $q$ approach $p$ along the function: two points define a line
  \item When $q = p$, we only have one point, so can't define a line: BAD
  \item Instead, observe the changing slope defines a function that
    inputs the $x$-value of $q$ and outputs the slope of the tangent
    line $$\mathop{slope}(x)= f(x)-f(x_p)/x-x_p$$ 
  \item The problem is that $\mathop{slope}(x)$ is undefined at
    $x=x_p$ so we invented limits because we \textbf{can} find
    $\lim\limits_{x \to x_p} \mathop{slope}(x)$
  \end{itemize}
  
\item[First def.\ of derivative]
  Let $f$ be a function. The derivative of $f$ at the point $x=a$ is $$f'(a)=\lim\limits_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
  
\item[Interpretation] This gives the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=a$. \textbf{Draw graph w tangent line}. If we think of this function as describing the distance of a planet from the sun changing in time, the slope of the tangent line shows how that distance is changing at one moment in time.  
  
  \begin{ws}
    Find the derivative for $f(x)=3/x$ at $x=2$. \\
    Use the derivative to find the equation of the tangent line.
  \end{ws}

  \begin{ws}
    Given the graph of $f(x)=3/x$ draw the tangent line you just found.
  \end{ws}

\item[Another persepctive]
  \textbf{Desmos 08-01 triangle}
  The distance $x-a$ gives the length of the bottom of the triangle. It can be easier to give that distance a new name $h = x-a$. Then, instead of taking the limit $x \to a$, we take the limit $h \to 0$
  
\item[Second def./ of derivative]
  Let $f$ be a function. The derivative of $f$ and $x=a$ is $$f'(a)=\lim\limits_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$.
  
\item[Why second def?]
  The denominator is simpler: $h$ instead of $x-a$. Also, this is more easily generalizable to a more abstract situation (that we'll see next class). However, taking these limits requires some prep work.
  
\item[Example] Simplify
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\dfrac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}$ for $f(x)=\dfrac{1/3x^2}$
  \item $\dfrac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}$ for $f(x)=\sqrt{2-x}$
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{ws}
    Using the second definition, find the derivative for $f(x)=3/x$ at
    $x=2$.
  \end{ws}

  \begin{ws}
    Use either definition to find the derivative for $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=1$
  \end{ws}

\item[Not differentiable] \hfill
  
  \begin{ws}
    Do all functions always have a derivative at any point? If not,
    what can go wrong.
  \end{ws}

  Find the derivative to $f(x)=|x|$ at $x=0$.
  
\item[Differentiable] For a function $f$ and a point $x=a$, if $f'(a)$ exists, we say the function is \emph{differentiable at $a$}.  In a way, if $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then that means there are no sharp corners to the function at $a$, and if $f$ is not, then there is a sharp corner at $a$.  

  \begin{ws}
    Find the derivative to $f(x)=2/\sqrt{x}$ at $x=4$. 
  \end{ws}

  \begin{ws}
    What is the tangent line to $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=-2$?
  \end{ws}
