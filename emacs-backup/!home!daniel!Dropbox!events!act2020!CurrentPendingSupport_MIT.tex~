% This section of the proposal calls for required
% information on all current and pending support for ongoing
% projects and proposals, including this project, and any
% subsequent funding in the case of continuing grants.  All
% current project support from whatever source (e.g.,
% Federal, State, local, foreign, public or private
% foundations, industrial or other commercial organizations,
% or internal funds allocated toward specific projects) must
% be listed.  The proposed project and all other projects or
% activities requiring a portion of time of the PI and any
% other senior personnel must be included, even if they
% receive no salary support from the project(s).  The total
% award amount for the entire award period covered
% (including indirect costs) must beshown as well as the
% number of person-months per year to be devoted to the
% project, regardless of source of support.  Similar
% information must be provided for all proposals already
% submitted or submitted concurrently to other possible
% sponsors, including NSF.  Concurrent submission of a
% proposal to other organizations will not prejudice its
% review by NSF.  The Biological Sciences Directorate
% exception to this policy is delineated in Chapter II.D.2.
% If the project now being submitted has been funded
% previously by a source other than NSF, the information
% requested in the paragraph above must be furnished for the
% last period of funding.  A separate current and pending
% support pdf file, or other approved NSF template, must be
% uploaded in FastLane for each individual designated as
% senior personnel.
