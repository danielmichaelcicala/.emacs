*** 27Feb: All students (not Leo,Gio) posts reading response about the paper
**** Workflow
***** 1. pull repo
***** 2. go to bottom of "a finite presentation" section of forum.tex
***** 3. type \iam{NAME} then reading response
***** 4. look through other responses and continue conversation by typing \respond{NAME} after their reading respons and any other follow up comments to that reading response
***** 5. compile and fix any errors
***** 6. > add . // > commit -m "NAME reading response" // > git push
**** Hector, you're the TA, so I'll ask that you check in periodically in the days leading up to and after the presentation to answer questions, clarify and correct.

* call for participation

Dear scientists, mathematicians, linguists, philosophers, and hackers,

I am writing to let you know about a fantasitic opportunity to learn
about the emerging interdisciplinary field of applied category theory
from some of the biggest researchers in the world.  It's called the
upcoming ACT2019-School on applied category theory.

What is applied category theory?  It is a topic of interest for a
growing community of researchers that are interested in studying
systems using category theoretic tools.  The systems studied are found
in the natural sciences, social sciences, linguistics, and
technology and the background of those in the community are as varied
as the systems being studied.  

The goal of the ACT2019-School is to help grow this community by
pairing ambitious young researchers together with established
researchers in order to prove conjectures in applied category theory.

_Who should apply?_

Anyone from anywhere who is interested
in applying category theoretic methods to problems outside of pure
mathematics. This is emphatically not restricted to math students, but
one should be comfortable working with mathematics.

We will consider advanced undergraduates, PhD students, or
post-docs. We ask that you commit to the full program as laid out below.

_What are the specific topics and who are the senior researchers?_

Here are the senior researchers, their projects, and the required
background reading.

Title: 
Simplifying quantum circuits using the ZX-calculus

Description:
The ZX-calculus is a graphical calculus based on the
catgory-theoretical formulation of quantum mechanics.  A
complete set of graphical rewrite rules is known for the
ZX-calculus, but not for a quantum circuit over any
universal gate set.  In this project, we aim to develop new
strategies for using the ZX-calculus to simplify quantum
circuits and test these on some benchmark circuits.

Title: 
Partial evaluation and the bar construction in risk management

Description:
We all know that 2+2+1+1 evaluates to 6. A less familiar notion is
that it can *partially evaluate* to 5+1.  In this project, we aim to
study the compositional structure of partial evaluation in terms of
monads and the bar construction and see what this has to do with
financial risk.

Title: 
Complexity classes, computation, and Turing categories

Description:
Turing categories form a categorical setting for studying
computability without bias towards any particular model of
computation. It is not currently clear, however, that Turing
categories are useful to study practical aspects of computation such
as complexity. This project revolves around the systematic study of
step-based computation in the form of stack-machines, the resulting
Turing categories, and complexity classes.  This will involve a study
of the interplay between traced monoidal structure and computation.
We will explore the idea of stack machines qua programming languages,
investigate the expressive power, and tie this to complexity theory.
We will also consider questions such as the following: can we
characterize Turing categories arising from stack machines? Is there
an initial such category? How does this structure relate to other
categorical structures associated with computability?

Title: 
Traversal optics and profunctors

Description:
In functional programming, optics are ways to zoom into a specific
part of a given data type and mutate it.  Optics come in many flavors
such as lenses and prisms and there is a well-studied categorical
viewpoint, known as profunctor optics.  Of all the optic types, only
the traversal has resisted a derivation from first principals into a
profunctor description.  This project aims to do just this.

Title: 
Formal and experimental methods to reason about dialogue and discourse using categorical models of vector spaces

Description: 
Distributional semantics argues that meanings of words
can be represented by the frequency of their co-occurrences in
context. A model extending distibutional sematantics from words to
sentences has a categorical interpretation via Lambek's syntactic
calculus or pregroups. In this project, we intend to further extend
this model to reason about dialogue and discourse utterances where
people interupt each other, there are disfluencies, pauses, and
corrections. Additionally, we would like to design experiments and run
toy models to verify predictions of the developed models.

Title: 
Metric realization of fuzzy simplicial sets

Description:
A fuzzy simplicial set is a simplicial set X equipped with a function
X --> [0,1] specifying the degree of membership of each simplex. In
this context, the "fuzzy geometric realization functor" goes by the
name "metric realization functor" and views fuzzy simplicial sets as
generating data for metric spaces.  Fuzzy simplicial sets can be seen
as a combinatorial manner in which to reason about operations on
metric spaces.  These ideas have recently inspired the UMAP algorithm,
a high-performing algorithm for dimension reduction and data
clustering.  In this project, we will further develope the theory of
fuzzy simplicial sets and investigate its applications in UMAP,
persistent homology, or other methods of data analysis.

_What is the school structure_

All of the participants will be divided up into groups corresponding
to the projects.  A group will consist of several students, a senior
researcher, and a TA. Between January and June, we will have a reading
course devoted to building the requisite background to meaningfully
participate in the projects. Specifically, two weeks are devoted to a
single paper from the reading list. During this two week period,
everybody will read the paper and contribute to discussion in an
private online chat forum.  There will be a TA serving as domain
expert who will be moderating this discussion. In the middle of the
two week period, the group corresponding to the paper will give a
presentation via video conference.  At the end of the two week period,
this group will compose a blog entry on this background reading that
will be posted to the n-cat cafe.

After all of the papers have been presented, there will be a two-week
visit to Oxford University from 15-26 July 2019.  The first week is
solely for participants of the ACT2019 School. Here, the groups will
work together to prove conjectures brought by the senior researchers.  

The second week of this visit is the ACT2019 Conference. Here, the
wider community will arrive for a conference in applied category
theory.

*title* Partial evaluations and higher rewriting 

*context* We all know how to evaluate algebraic expressions
involving numerical values. For example, 2 + 3 + 1 evaluates to 6; but
it also partially evaluates to 5 + 1. In this course, we will study
the general structure of partial evaluations in terms of monads and
the bar construction, learn about what this has to do with financial
risk, and investigate the general compositional properties of partial
evaluations and higher categorical aspects. Concretely, applying the
bar construction to an algebra of a monad on a concrete category
results in a simplicial set which encodes these partial evaluations,
and whose compositional structure has so far not been studied.

*project* There are many possible research questions that
we can ask. Just to name a few: Given a weakly cartesian monad on a
concrete category, which compositional properties do the simplicial
sets arising from the bar construction have? In particular, under what
conditions is it a quasi-category? It should be fun to work out as
many examples as we can.  For a cartesian monad, the bar construction
gives the nerve of a category, which we could call the "rewriting
category". Looking at some interesting examples of cartesian monads,
can we find a more explicit description of this rewriting category?
What is the meaning of its hom-sets?  Could there be computer science
applications of higher rewriting via higher-dimensional simplices in
the bar construction? Do we get a sensible concept of proof homotopy?
Does the idea of partial evaluations extend to doctrines other than
monads, such as operads or PROPs? How exactly? And is there a common
doctrinal framework?  Relating to network theory, does it make sense
to think of black-boxing as a total evaluation? Is there also some
higher categorical structure on the associated partial evaluations?

*title* Traversal optics and profunctors  

*context* The Haskell optics libraries can be described as a system
for factorizing objects in a monoidal category. Objects that are
tensor products can be equipped with pairs of morphisms, one focusing
on the factor, and one replacing a factor with another object to get anew compound object. For lenses, these are called getters and setters.

We can form a category of optics in which pairs of objects of C (in
other words, objects of C^op x C) are connected by pairs of morphisms.

The connection between a pair of foci and a pair of compound objects
can be expressed using relations: whenever two foci are related, the
compounds are related too. Relations, in this case, are expressed as
profunctors. These profunctors form categories that can be equipped
with additional structures. In particular, the category of Tambara
modules, profunctors equipped with tensorial action, gives rise to two
important optics: lenses and prisms. Lenses correspond to cartesian,
and prisms to cocartesian actions.

Tensorial actions can be generalized to arbitrary families of
functors, just like multiplication and addition can be generalized to
group representations. One such functor family produces another
interesting optic, the grate.

*project* The project will focus on one remaining type of
optic called the traversal that has not yet been successfully derived
from first principles. It describes objects with zero or more
foci. The profunctor description of a traversal involves the
combination of cartesian, cocartesian, and monoidal actions. We can
picture the first two as analogous to rotations and shifts, but the
last one looks more like a non-linear transformation. Accordingly,
free actions of Tambara modules are straightforward to generate, while
free monoidal profunctors can only be obtained as initial algebras.

*title* Complexity classes, computation, and Turing categories

*context* Turing categories [1] form a categorical setting for
studying computability without bias toward any particular model of
computation (Turing machines, say). The framework captures all known
combinatorially complete models, such as standard computability
theory, partial combinatory algebras, lambda models, and so
on. Various basic results from the theory of computation such as the
recursion theorems can be proved in this abstract setting, while in
order to obtain results more specific to the standard model one may
add further categorical structure, thus obtaining a clear picture
about what structural ingredients are necessary for certain results.

While Turing categories are wonderfully abstract, it is not clear a
priori that they are of any use in the study of more practical aspects
of computation, e.g., complexity.

In [2], however, it was shown that it is possible to construct Turing
categories whose total maps are exactly those belonging to a
prescribed complexity class. One of the ingredients in the
construction is that in a categorical setting with a particle-style
trace [3] and an object satisfying some mild domain equations (much
weaker than a reflexive object), we may build a so-called stack
machine, which executes a simple program.

*project* This project revolves around the systematic study of
step-based computation in the form of stack machines, as well as the
resulting Turing categories and complexity classes. In particular,
this involves the study of the interplay between traced monoidal
structure and computation. We will explore the idea of stack machines
qua programming languages, investigate the expressive power, and tie
this to complexity theory.

On the categorical level, we will study the Turing categories arising
from stack machines, and consider questions such as the following: can we characterize Turing categories arising from stack machines? Is
there an initial such category? How does this structure relate to
other categorical structure commonly associated with computability
(e.g. a natural numbers object)?

*title* Formal and experimental methods to reason about dialogue and
discourse using categorical models of vector spaces

*context* Distributional semantics argues that meanings of words
can be represented by the frequency of their co-occurrences in
context. This intuition has been coded in co-occurrence matrices and
turned into an attractive, easy to implement, and quite successful
vector space model of meaning. It has found applications in computing
similarity and applied to areas such as indexing and disambiguation as
well as AI tasks such as summarisation and parsing. This model has
been extended from words to sentences, by turning the grammatical
structures of sentences into linear maps that act on word meanings and
compose them with each other. If one uses type-driven grammars such as
Lambek’s syntactic calculus, which is based on closed monoidal
categories, or his pregroups, which is based on compact closed
categories, one gets a straightforward categorical interpretation for
this model.  This categorical model, developed by Coecke, Sadrzadeh,
and Clark, has been implemented on real data and some of its
predictions have been successfully verified. It has also been extended
to include density matrices and convex spaces to model polyseym,
entailment, and reasoning about concepts. In the current project, we
propose to go beyond sentence and senesce-level tasks and develop a
categorical model that is able reason about dialogue and discourse
utterances. In dialogue, one often does not have clear cut complete
and grammatical utterances, people interrupt each other, there are
disfluencies, pauses, and corrections. [1] shows how an incremental
syntactic framework called Dynamic Syntax (developed by Kempson,
Meyer-Viol, Gabbay) can be used to incrementally parse dialogue
utterances using types. For discourse, one needs to be able to glue
sentences to each other by resolving references such as pronouns and
elliptical phrases. Example thereof are ``John slept. He snored. I put
the cup on the plate, It broke. Cats chase dogs, so do foxes”, and
mixtures of both in ambiguous examples such as ``John likes his code,
and so does Mary.”. [2] shows how one can use an extension of Lambek
calculus to reason about these phenomena syntactically.

*project* The goal of this project is to firstly and
foremostly develop categorical models that use some kind of
type-driven model of syntax for dialogue and discourse and develop a
categorical compositional/incremental vector space semantics for
them. Secondly, we would like to design experiments and if time allows
to run toy models for them to be able to verify the predictions of the
developed models.
