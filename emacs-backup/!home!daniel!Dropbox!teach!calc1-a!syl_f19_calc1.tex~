\Title{$\S$\,II: Instructor's Addendum to the Syllabus}
\SubTitle{For \Course\Coursesection \Coursename}
\vspace*{0.8em}

\textbf{Disclaimer: I reserve the right to make changes to this syllabus as I see it fits the progress of the learning process. These changes can include, for example, additions or removal of assessment components; dates of quizzes and exams; due dates of assignments; etc. I will inform the students about these changes in a timely manner through email and classroom announcements.}\\

\noindent
This is Part II, i.e., the instructors portion of the
syllabus for this course.  Part I contains a complete
overview of Department, College and University requirements
along with the standard curriculum content for this course
can be found at \Urls{\Syllabusparti}.\\

\Subtopic{Required Textbook} 
Note that we will \textbf{\textit{not}} be using MyMathLabs
for online homework as part of a student's grade in this
course. Students are, however, encouraged to use MyMathLabs
as a valuable learning and study tool provided with
\Coursetext.

\Topic{Specific Assessments Requirements for \Course\Coursesection}
Each student is assessed based on a computed point score from 0 to 100. 

\Subtopic{Class Participation/Assignments}
During each class period, we will be working (individually and/or in groups) on several examples that I will provide. Maintaining a well-organized journal for taking notes throughout the semester is an excellent way to study. Every day I will assign a set of problems that will be posted on BlackBoard. I will collect these and grade a very few selected problems and grade the rest by completion. These HW assignments are worth $10 \%$ of the final grade. There is $5\%$ of the final grade on quizzes.  There is a $5 \%$ of the final grade on participation/attendance/engagement/presenting. 

\Subtopic{Exams}
There will be three exams ($E_1, E_2, E_3$) each worth $15 \%$ of the final grade and a comprehensive final exam (FE) worth $30 \%$ of the final grade.  Each exam will have specific instructions, but the following generally apply to all exams:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Tests are closed books and notes.  Calculators are not
    allowed.
  \item Cell phones must be turned off and stowed
    throughout the exam.  Any use of a cell phone will
    result in an exam grade of zero (0).
  \item I reserve the right to seat you in a way that
    I find suitable for the exams, hence you will be
    occasionally moved from your usual seating.
  \item Any attempt to cheat will be dealt with
    according to the misconduct code. Students who
    have been found to have violated the rules
    governing academic integrity will, at the very
    least receive a 0 grade on the paper or exam which
    was the source of the violation, and may be
    subject to further penalties as allowed by the
    University.
\end{compactitem}  

% ===================================
% The mastery exam is no longer in use
% ====================================
%
% \Subtopic{Mastery Exams}
% The Department requires that all students pass a
% Mastery Test covering the material on differentiation. 
% Passing this exam is a necessary condition for successfully
% completing this class, i.e., students who do not successfully complete
% the Mastery Test, regardless of their performance in the course,
% cannot earn a passing grade.

% Students have three opportunities to complete the  Mastery Test
% which is also closed book and notes.
% A minimum score of 70\% is required to pass the test (no partial credit
% is given on this exam). Students who
% do not pass on the first attempt have two subsequent opportunities
% to attain a  passing score. Students who do not pass on either of the first
% two attempts are required to review
% the Mastery Test with the instructor so that they can understand how to
% correct and avoid the mistakes they have made. Students are encouraged
% to study intensively for the Mastery Test and sample Mastery Tests
% are available to help the students prepare for this exam.

% Students who fail to pass the Mastery Test, regardless of their performance
% in class, will be assigned a grade based on their TPS or C\;- grade (non-passing),
% whichever is lower, for the course.

%In addition there is one project assigned as part of this class,
%worth 50 points.

%The course grade is based on the
%average score obtained on all exams, for a
%total of at most 300 points. The student's total score is obtained by
%averaging these 300 points and then adding the bonus points
%to the average score. The total point  score (TPS) is the basis for grade
%assignment.

%\Subtopic{Homework, Quizzes, and Projects}
%Homework is required to be completed on time. You should have at least attempted the problems by the posted date, use that class period to discuss specific issues with the homework.  All homework will be collectible the day after the posted due date.  Some assignments will be collected on a random basis and there will be some assignments/projects that will be collected as announced.  Additionally, homework completion will be evaluated using frequent quizzes that will be based on the homework.  

\Subtopic{Scoring and Course Grades}
The letter grade is based on the student's total point score (TPS) for the
semester.  The class letter grade is assigned based on

\Subtopic{Grade Calculation}

The TPS will be calculated using the formula

\[ \ec  0.1\ (Assignments)+ 0.05\ (Presentation/Participation)+ 0.1\ (Quizzes) + 0.3\ FE +0.15\ (E_1+E_2+E_3).\]

\Subtopic{Further Considerations and Rules}
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textit{Email correspondence}: When using emails to
  correspond with me, be sure to include your full name and
  the course-section you attend. I usually respond within 24
  hours. Please do not expect a reply after 6pm or during
  the weekend.

\item \textit{Electronic devices}: The use of phones and
  electronic devices, except in an emergency or unless
  otherwise approved by the instructor, is disallowed in
  class. The use of any electronic device, except those
  explicitly approved for use during any exam, will result
  in grade of $0$ on that exam. If in doubt, please inquire
  prior to using any electronic device.

\item \textit{Late Papers}: Any material handed in late
  without having obtained prior approval or without having a
  valid university excused absence (e.g., a signed medical
  excuse) will not be accepted. All papers are due at the
  start of class.  Material handed in over one week late
  without prior approval is not accepted.
  
\item \textit{Scheduling conflicts}: It is the student's
  responsibility to contact the instructor concerning any
  scheduling conflicts which may result in late papers, or
  other scheduling conflicts, e.g., an absence for an exam.
