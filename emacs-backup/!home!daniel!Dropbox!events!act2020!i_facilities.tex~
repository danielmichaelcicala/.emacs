The resources required for the School fall into three
categories: (i) technology, (ii) rooms, (iii) personnel.

The only technology required is a video conferencing
software for the online reading seminar.  The PI, through
the University of New Haven, has an account with Zoom. All
other participants can access Zoom without an account.

During the in-person research week, MIT will offer each
working group a room in which to work.  This includes white
boards and markers.

The personnel required for the School include three
organizers, four mentors, four TAs, and the students.  The
organizers and mentors have already agreed to
participate. The TA's and the students will be selected before
January 2020.
