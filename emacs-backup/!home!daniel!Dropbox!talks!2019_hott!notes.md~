# HoTT 2019 Notes

## E. Riehl // equivariant uniforn kan fibration model of
cubical homotopy type theory

* goal: contruct a cubical sets model of HoTT with a Quillen
model structure

* cubes // equiv to spaces?

** symmeetric cubes = { faces, degeneracies } // no.
** cartesian cubes={faces, dgn, sym, diagonals} // No
** demorgan cubes={faces, diagonals, symetric, degeneracies,
  connections, reversal} // no
** dedekind cubes=demorgan - reversal} // ?? open question

* Main Theorem: Equivariant uniform kan fibrations on
cartesian cubical sets satisfy the above

* talk plan
** the EZ category of cartesian cubes
** equivariant uniform kan fibrations
** quillen equivalence to spaces

## part 1

* Presheaves(CC) of PS(CC) := category of cubical sets.
where CC is the category
(objects) I^0,I^1,I^2 ... (I=[0,1])
(maps) face maps I^{n-1} >--> I^n
degeneracies I^n -->> I^{n-1}
symetries I^n --> I^n (isos)
diagonals diagonal I^n >--> I^{n+1}

*Prop* PS(CC) is an Eilenbery-Zilbar category, i.e. each
object has a dimenstion and
(1) forall (isos,non-invert monos,non-invert epis) the dimen
of the domain is (=,<,>) the dimantion of the codomain
(2) all maps I^n --> I^m factor to split epi and monic
(3) split epis have absolute pushouts, that is they are
preserved by any functor

## part 2

*defn* f : x --> y in PS(CC) is a uniform trivial fibration:
for all monos
c ----x-----> X                       
V             |  so for all pullbacks D -a-> C -x-> X   
|             f                       |      |      |
c             |                       d      g      f 
|             V                       V      V      V 
V             V                       I^m ->I^n ->  Y
I^n ----x-->  Y

_general construction of trivial fibrations_

C         pt      I^n wedge C x I  (open box)
|         |             |
c    xhat in  =        monic
|         |             |
I^n       I            I^nxI


# Awody: quillen model str on cubical sets

_How are models of HoTT related to Quillen model
structures?_

* first models of HoTT from quillen model cats,speical weak
factorization systems on spaces and simplicial sets,
kan-quillen model structure on simplicial sets

* Or, start with HoTT model and construct quillen model str

*def* a _premodel_ of HoTT consists of
(1) groth topos E
(2) representable class of monos \Phi \to \Omega that form
a dominance and ...
(3) I an interval 1 -> I and 1 -> I in E that is _tiny_, so
(-)^I -| (-)_I
(4) V-->V is a universe of small fmailies closed under
Sigma,Prod and ...
==> a model is taking an extentional topos E with this

From a premodel, one can construct a QMS on E w nice
properties

* Given a premodel with cubical sets
1) use Phi to determine an algebraic weak factorization
system (C,TFib)
2) use I to determine another on (TCof, F)
3) let W=TFib o TCof and from 3 for 2 from FEP

*DEF* The *fibration extension proety* says that fibrations
extend along trivial cofibrations:
A ---->A'
|      |  vert maps are fibrations // hor maps triv cofibs
X >--->X'
