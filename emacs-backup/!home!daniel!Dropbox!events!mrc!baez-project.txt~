John Baez will lead students in studying open gene regulatory networks.   A gene regulatory network is a collection of molecules and reactions that govern the expression of genes in a cell.  These are mathematically modeled in a variety of ways, the simplest being a Boolean network, where time proceeds in discrete steps and each node is either "on" or "off" depending on whether its neighboring nodes are on or off at the previous time step.    Petri nets can be used for more detailed models.

Since gene regulatory networks are complex, they are typically discovered in experiments one piece at a time.  These pieces are "open" gene regulatory networks, where the expression of certain genes depends on inputs that are not yet modeled as part of the network.   Researchers then assemble these open networks into larger networks which provide more detailed models.  

Mathematically, the process of building larger open networks from smaller ones is described by Fong's theory of decorated cospans, or the newer formalism of structured cospans developed by Courser.   Using research of Baez and Master, the biologist Wu has recently used these ideas to model gene regulatory networks as open Petri nets.  Baez's students will construct and study a category whose morphisms are open Boolean networks.
