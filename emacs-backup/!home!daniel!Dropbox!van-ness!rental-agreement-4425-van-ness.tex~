  \textbf{RENTAL AMOUNT:} Beginning \emph{FILL IN DATE OF
    CONTRACT START}, TENANT agrees to pay LANDLORD the sum
  of \emph{FILL IN RENT PRICE} per month in advance on the
  \emph{first} day of each calendar month. A fee of \$20 per
  per is added to the monthly rent price.  Said rental
  payment shall be delivered by TENANT to LANDLORD or
  his/her designated agent by electronic transfer, Venmo,
  PayPal, Zelle, or, alternatively, by mailing a personal or
  cashier's check so that LANDLORD receives it on or before
  the first day of the calendar month for which the rent
  applies. Rent must be received by LANDLORD or designated
  agent in order to be considered in compliance with the
  terms of this agreement.

  left, leaving the premises vacant, the LANDLORD may use
  the security deposit for the cleaning of the premises, any
  unusual wear and tear to the premises or common areas, and
  any rent or other amounts owed pursuant to the lease
  agreement or pursuant to Civil Code Section 1950.5. TENANT
  may not use said deposit for rent owed during the term of
  the lease.  Within 21 days of the TENANT vacating the
  premises, LANDLORD shall furnish TENANT a written
  statement indicating any amounts deducted from the
  security deposit and returning the balance to the
  TENANT. If TENANT fails to furnish a forwarding address to
  LANDLORD, then LANDLORD shall send said statement and any
  security deposit refund to the leased premises.

  inspect the premises during normal business hours and upon

  vacate the unit, then TENANT shall vacate for this
  temporary period upon being served a 7 days notice by
  LANDLORD. TENANT agrees that in such event that TENANT
  will be solely compensated by a corresponding reduction in
  rent for those many days that TENANT was temporarily

  tasks shall be performed upon serving 24 hours written
  notice by LANDLORD. (EXAMPLE -removing food items from
  cabinets so that the unit may be sprayed for pests)

  responsibility of the LANDLORD, TENANT must notify
  LANDLORD with a written notice stating what item needs
  servicing or repair. TENANT must give LANDLORD a reasonable
  opportunity to service or repair said item. TENANT
  acknowledges that rent will not be withheld unless a
  written notice has been served on LANDLORD giving LANDLORD
  a reasonable time to fix said item within the meaning of

  breach of the warrantee of habitability as stated in Code

  the unit.
  
\item

  property insurance policy to cover any losses sustained to
  TENANT'S personal property or vehicle. It is acknowledged
  that LANDLORD does not maintain this insurance to cover
  personal property damage or loss caused by fire, theft,
  rain, water overflow/leakage, acts of GOD, and/or any
  other causes.

  It is acknowledged that LANDLORD is not liable for these
  occurrences. It is acknowledged that TENANT'S insurance
  policy shall solely indemnify TENANT for any losses
  sustained. TENANT'S failure to maintain said policy shall
  be a complete waiver of TENANT'S right to seek damages
  against LANDLORD for the above stated losses. The parties

  security building which would hold LANDLORD to a higher
  degree of care.

  notice in 18 days, the premises shall be deemed abandoned.

\item

  \textbf{WAIVER:} LANDLORD'S failure to require compliance
  with the conditions of this agreement, or to exercise any
  right provided herein, shall not be deemed a waiver by
  LANDLORD of such condition or right.  LANDLORD'S
  acceptance of rent with knowledge of any default under
  agreement by TENANT shall not be deemed a waiver of such
  default, nor shall it limit LANDLORD'S rights with respect
  to that or any subsequent right. If is further agreed
  between the parties that the payment of rent at any time
  shall not be a waiver to any UNLAWFUL DETAINER action

  this constitutes a waiver to the UNLAWFUL DETAINER action.

  controversy.  On this basis, all parties waive their
  rights to have any matter settled by jury trial.

  deemed served upon mailing by first class mail, addressed

  consult with independent legal counsel before entering
  into this Agreement and has decided to waive such
  representation and advice. TENANT acknowledges that TENANT
  has read and understood this agreement and has been
