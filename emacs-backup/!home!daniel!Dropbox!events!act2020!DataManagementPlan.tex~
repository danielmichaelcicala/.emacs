\begin{document}
\maketitle

No data is associated with the activities of this
School. Any results arising from the projects are to be
disseminated on the popular (among researchers in category
theory) blog ``the n-category cafe''. Pre-prints will be
posted on the arXiv and Mentors will decide how to approach
publications.
