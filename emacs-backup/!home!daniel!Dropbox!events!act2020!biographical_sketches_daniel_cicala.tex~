\textbf{Publications:}

% A list of: (i) up to five products most closely related to
% the proposed project; and (ii) up to five other
% significant products, whether or not related to the
% proposed project.  Acceptable products must be citable and
% accessible including but not limited to publications, data
% sets, software, patents, and copyrights.  Unacceptable
% products are unpublished documents not yet submitted for
% publication, invited lectures, and additional lists of
% products.  Only the list of ten will be used in the review
% of the proposal.Each product must include full citation
% information including (where applicable and practicable)
% names of all authors, date of publication or release,
% title, title of enclosing work such as journal or book,
% volume, issue, pages, website and URL, or other Persistent
% Identifier.If only publications are included, the heading
% “Publications” may be used for this section of the
% Biographical Sketch.

\textbf{Synergistic Activities:}

% A list of up to five distinct examples that demonstrate
% the broader impact of the individual’s professional and
% scholarly  activities  that  focuses  on  the  integration
% and  transfer  of  knowledge  as  well  as  its  creation.
% Examples should be specific and could include, among
% others:  innovations in teaching and training (e.g.,
% development  of  curricular  materials  and  pedagogical
% methods);  contributions  to  the  science  of  learning;
% development and/or refinement of research tools;
% computation methodologies and algorithms for
% problem-solving;  development  of  databases  to  support
% research  and  education;  broadening  the  participation
% of  groups underrepresented in STEM; and service to the
% scientific and engineering community outside of the
% individual’s immediate organization.  Examples with
% multiple components are not permitted.A separate
% biographical sketch pdf file, or other NSF-approved
% template, must be uploaded in FastLane for each individual
% designated as senior personnel.
