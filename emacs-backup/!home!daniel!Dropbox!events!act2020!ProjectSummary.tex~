\section*{Summary}

This is a proposal to fund the Applied Category Theory
Adjoint School 2020. Participating in this School are four
groups, each comprising a leading expert, a TA of the
expert's choice, and four students who are selected by an
open application process. Each ground pursues a research
project in applied category theory designed by the leading
expert.

The School has two components. The first, for which no
funding is required, is a sixteen week long online seminar
on readings, chosen by the experts, that provide background
needed for the research projects. TA's guide students
through assigned papers and facilitate discussions. To each
paper is devoted one lecture and one expository article
delivered by a chosen pair of students. The reading seminar
culminates in a week long visit, for which funding is being
requested, to MIT where all participants conduct their
research under the direction of the leading expert and TA.

The School is followed by the Applied Category Theory
Conference which is independent of this proposal.  This
conference is split into two components: research talks and
structured conversation around recent developments in the
field. Leading experts from industry and academia attend the
conference thus providing an opportunity for them and School
participants to work and socialize together. Time is
reserved for students to discuss their work from the School.

\section*{Intellectual Merit}

Four research projects are pursued at this
School. Prof.~Michael Shulman of the University of San Diego
leads a project on developing a type theory that corresponds
to the kinds of categories frequently used in applied
category theory. The success of this research would provide
a dictionary for programmers to implement categorical
structure into software. Such software can scientists and
engineers the benefits of applied category theory without
the burden of having to learn it.

Valeria de Paiva of Samsung Research America leads the
second project in studying the abstract structure of a
`lens'. A lens, initially from database theory, is a pair of
functions that model the updating of one system using
information from another. This structure has recently been
discovered in functional programming, backpropagation in
machine learning, economic game theory and other locations.
Dr.~de Paiva's research project will try to better
understand lenses.

\section*{Broader Impacts}

This School aims to increase diversity and inclusion in the
applied category theory community and to build a stronger
relationship between academia and industry.

Regarding diversity and inclusion, the School will be
advertised to potential students through established
networks in the applied category theory community and also
though the National Association of Mathematicians, the
Association for Women in Mathematics, Spectra, the Society
for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in the
Sciences.  

A strong relationship between industry and academia exists
because of a consensus on the importance of this
relationship to the success of applied category theory.
Category theory informs work at various US companies and
government agencies. By selecting representatives from
industry and academia as our project leads and students, the
relationship will be further strengthened.
