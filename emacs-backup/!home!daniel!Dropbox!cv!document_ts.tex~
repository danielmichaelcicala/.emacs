\noindent {\LARGE \textsc{On Teaching}}

\noindent \rule{12.5cm}{0.4pt} 

\noindent Daniel Cicala, UC Riverside

\vspace{2em}

My teaching philosophy addresses five axes: personal
motivation, style, method, learning, and assessment.  My
approach to teaching, which I outline below, has developed
over seven years of teaching, three of which I served as the
instructor of record.

\vspace{2em}

\textbf{Personal motivation.}  There are selfish reasons for
my choosing to teach: I enjoy it. What drives me to teach,
however, is my social conscience. Because education is a
gatekeeper to improving ones social and economic standing,
it is important to work with vulnerable populations and
first generation university students. I currently teach at
the University of California, Riverside which is one of the
largest American educators of diverse populations with
regard to race and socio-economics.  I am also an instructor
on record at Mt.~San Jacinto College and Riverside City
College.  All three are Hispanic serving institutions.
Here, I have met many students who are not only the first in
their family to attend university, but are the first to grow
up in the United States.  Many such students lack the
privilege to focus only on their studies.  I have had
students carrying employer demands, language barriers, or
family responsibilities.  Therefore, I make my lecture notes
and exercises available if asked and also excuse absences
for reasons beyond physical health. For instance, I have
worked to help a student suffering from depression to catch
up with their classmates after a prolonged absence. I have
also worked together with a student who was often tardy
because she would bring her younger brother to school so
that her mother could take a morning shift at work. I have
had yet another student whose son required frequent doctor
visits.  I do not punish students when life gets in the way,
and so I make allowances such as emailing a photograph of
their homework or providing a day of lecture notes.  In the
end, teaching is how I am best equipped to give back to my
community, and am serious about it.

\vspace{2ex}

\textbf{Style.}  Stylistically, I strive to be lively. I
maintain a high energy in hopes that it permeates the room.
My first goal of a lecture is to see active participation
from students. Better outcomes tend to follow from
engagement.  To this end, I pose many questions to the
class; some easy, others hard.  For each answer I receive, I
respond with praise. Given a wrong response, I describe how
reasonable their idea was or why I am glad for their answer.
Incorrect answers stimulate learning by opening new avenues
of discussion.  Hence, I encourage mistakes.  Reacting with
positivity and encouragement after a student speaks injects
more energy into the classroom and begets student
engagement.  Conversely, I avoid certain traits that damage
the student-teacher relationship.  In particular,
condescension and arrogance isolate even the most motivated
students.  No one should be made to feel ``less than'',
especially in a learning environment.

\vspace{2ex}

\textbf{Method.}  Even with compelling lectures, it is easy
for students to grow bored after sitting still for an hour
and a half.  So, I use several communication methods
during a typical class. There is great value in watching a
teacher work through an example, provide their insights,
highlight potential pitfalls, and form connections to a
larger picture. But mathematics is not a spectator sport.
Providing students with exercises and feedback is important.
Math is also a social activity and I find that group work is
an effective practice space as well as a way for students to
form social bonds, which often increases motivation.  At
Mt.~San Jacinto College, I used roughly one third of my time
for group work designed to complement the day's lecture.
Some exercises are typical calculations, while others are
more open ended.  Here is an example of the latter I give
while introducing limits.  I sketch the graph of some
continuous function $f \from \RR \setminus \{x\} \to \RR$
with a removable discontinuity, jump continuity, or vertical
asymptote at $ x $.  I ask what values $ f( x ) $ might
``want'' to take.  This type of activity encourages
conversation, investigative thinking, and highlights the
creativity of mathematics. 

Group work also provides students an opportunity to teach
their peers, further reinforcing their own knowledge.  This
way, math becomes more than exercises from a text.  It
is a creative activity in which computation is
not always of central importance.  Students ask more
questions while in small groups than open lecture. This
gives me helpful feedback on student understanding, allowing
me to adjust needs in real time.

The closest formal pedagogical method to my own is the
Moore method. This involves given students a minimal amount
of information they need to get started then forcing them to
figure out the rest. I personally also give guidance and
suggestions, which is not part of the Moore methodology.
There are also other, quite extreme, conditions of the Moore
method relating to restricting additional course materials
and help. I do not subscribe to this, but I do believe that
guiding student self and group learning leads to a greater
depth of understand. One trades the breadth of topics
covered, but the trade-off is well worth it.

\vspace{2ex}

\textbf{Learning.}  What would I say is `learning'?  My
ideal outcome is to have students engage in mathematical
materials with confidence. This does not mean they should
know all the answers, but how to organize and apply
knowledge to which they have access.  One might say this
coincides with the concept of \emph{mathematical maturity}
or \emph{mathematical literacy}.  For instance, I am not
looking for students to remember every trigonometric
identity.  I prefer they understand the geometric meaning of
identities or the relationships between them.  Instead of
having someone memorize the unit circle, I'll teach how to
use symmetry and the values of certain basic angles to
compute values of new angles. Undergraduate students should
learn \emph{how} to approach problems.

\vspace{2ex}

\textbf{Assessment.} Fair or not, assessing a student
has become the most consequential part of teaching. Grades
are what allow a student to earn their degree, win a
scholarship, attend graduate school, and sometimes get an entry level position. This increases the
importance of assessment yet one must strike a balance
between probing student knowledge and maintaining a
reasonable workload.  With regard to exercises, repeating an algorithm is unenlightening.  Such experience is
necessary, but should not be over emphasized. I hand these
out as ungraded group work and ask them to
perform a couple of these questions on a low stakes
quiz. This motivates groups to help each other understand
the material.

An ideal homework assignment tells a story and builds to
highlight the central topic at hand.  An example of such an
assignment I have used in an elementary algebra course at
both Riverside City College and Mt.~San Jacinto is to
introduce the algebra of polynomials parallel to the algebra
of the integers.  On such assignments, I want solutions to
contain some exposition explaining their computations.
Teaching exposition is time intensive but some providing
model solutions is helpful and I have seen progress.
Another activity I have used to teach mathematical
exposition is, within the group worksheets, to let students
grade and provide comments on `solutions' designed by me.

The other usual way to assess learning is through exams.
Timed exams separate students by knowledge, speed, and math
anxiety.  To reduce the effect of slowness and math anxiety,
I design a test to take an average student roughly half the
allotted time to complete the exam and I advertise this
fact.  To separate students according to knowledge, I do not
grade questions by assigning point values to certain goal
posts in the solution.  Instead, I give an `A' for a full
and correct solution, with some leeway for errors that are
trivial relative to the question asked. Substantial progress
towards a correct solution gets a `B' while some progress
earns a `C'.  This is more subjective than having a
checkpoint-based rubric, but it considers the full answer.
