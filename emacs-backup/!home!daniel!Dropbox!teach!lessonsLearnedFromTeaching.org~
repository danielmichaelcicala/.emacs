#+TITLE: Lessons Learned from Teaching
#+STARTUP: indent align inlineimages nologdone

* make all quiz and exam q's worth 4 points as corresponds to gpa scale 

* more interaction between students

* have extra list of puzzles on website for extra credit. they should be real math, writing proofs, proving a theorem perhaps

* don't call the quizzes 'quizzes', the term is too loaded.  call them something else, like 'probl√®me du jour'

* use org mode to export html for website things like HW assignments

* really need to emphasize how to hand in a clean sheet of hw.

* 2-3 hours per credit out of class time is reasonable.

* make it clear in the syllabus that the website is the 'official hw list' and what i write in class is unofficial.
* take notes on common issues from HW and topics struggled on in class.  Mention those out loud and be non-subtle.  Test and quiz on those.
* make hw on outlook or google forms. 
* a have a lot of moving parts, should reduce them.
** homework
** quizzes
** corrections
** lectures
** solutions
** labs (stats)
* in last minute of class, ask three questions for them to turn in: (1) what was the main topic of the day (2) what is one or two important points about this topic (3) what question do you have about this topic
* do mutliple choice q's on my website and have them answer in the body of an email / using blackboard / uploading photo. Then have a quiz (not mult choice) after I grade those. Then have quiz grade bumped up if they show me all incorrect work in office hours.
* at the end of each class, ask the following questions about the Topic
** what are three significant things you learned about the Topic
** what questions do you have about the Topic
** why are we studying the Topic
* think-pair-share: pose a question to the class, have students write their thoughts on paper, then they swap papers and look at another students then discuss.  e.g. for extreme value thm, have them draw a graph on an interval [a,b], ask to raise hands if holding a graph w a minimum, a max, both. What conditions are being used, are they necessary, etc
* have a review test for precalc that they can take unlimited times, but must pass before the semester is over to pass the class
* HW done on an Outlook Form or something, multichoice, and to get credit, they need to do all correctly, but they have unlimited attempts.
