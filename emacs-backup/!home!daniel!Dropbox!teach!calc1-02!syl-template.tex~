\Subtopic{Required Textbook}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\Topic{Specific Assessments Requirements for \Course\Coursesection}
Each student is assessed based on a computed point score from 0 to 100.

\Subtopic{In-class structure}




% Describe

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\Subtopic{Homework}

On my website listed above, you will find a number of
homework problems and their due date. They are to be handed
in together with the associated quiz (see the Quizzes
section for more details) on the due date.  Late assignments
will not be accepted without a university approved
reason. Assignments that are not stapled or without names
will not receive credit.

Each homework will be given a score between 0 and 10 that
corresponds with the percentage of the assignment you
completed. For a question to count as ``completed'' you must
either have provided a full, though not necessarily correct,
answer. In lieu of a full answer, you can either
\begin{enumerate}
  \item discuss the question with me in my office hours prior to
    the due date of the related assignment, or
  \item write a short paragraph that examines exactly why
    you had difficulty.
\end{enumerate}

Homework is worth 10\% of your total grade.

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\Subtopic{Quizzes and group-work}

At the beginning of every class in which a homework is due,
there will be a ten minutes long quiz.  This quiz will
consist of questions pulled *directly* from the assigned
homework. You may not use your text or any electronics,
during the quiz, but you may refer to your notes. The
associated homework is to be turned in together with the
quiz. Each question, graded for correctness and clarity,
will be given a score between 0 and 10. 

After the completion of each chapter, there will be 30
minutes of in-class time devoted to group work where you
will be completing a worksheet consisting of questions from
that chapter. No texts, notes, or electronics may be used.
Each student must turn in their own work. Each question,
graded for correctness, will be given a score between 0 and
10. Individual students can improve their score by coming to
office hours and working through their mistakes.

Quizzes and worksheets each contribute to 15\% of your total
grade.

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\Subtopic{Exams}

There are two exams during the semester and one final
exam. All exams are closed notes and closed
books. Calculators and other electronics are also not
allowed. Any attempt to cheat will be dealt with according
to the misconduct code.  Students who have found to violate
the rules governing academic integrity will receive a 0
grade on the associated exam and may be subject to further
penalties as allowed by the University.

Each midterm exam contributes 15\% to your total grade.  The
final exam contributes to 30\% of the total grade.

\Subtopic{Scoring and Course Grades}
The letter grade is based on the student's total point score
for the semester.  The class letter grade is assigned based
on

\Subtopic{Grade Calculation}

The total grade will be calculated using the formula
\[
  0.10 (\textrm{homework}) +
  0.15 (\textrm{quizzes}) +
  0.15 (\textrm{worksheets}) +
  0.30 (\textrm{midterm exams}) +
  0.30 (\textrm{final exam})
\]

\Subtopic{Further Considerations and Rules}
\begin{compactitem}
\item
  \textit{Email correspondence}: When sending me an email,
  be sure to include your full name and the course-section
  you attend.
\item
  \textit{Late Papers}: Any material handed in late without
  having obtained prior approval or without having a valid
  university excused absence (e.g., a signed medical excuse)
  will not be accepted.
\item
  \textit{Scheduling conflicts}: It is the student's
  responsibility to contact the instructor concerning any
  scheduling conflicts which may result in late papers, or
  other scheduling conflicts, e.g., an absence for an exam.
\end{compactitem}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\Subtopic{Course Outline Schedule}

\Semester\ classes are from \Startsemesterclasses\ to
\Endsemesterclasses.  The last day to drop classes without
any financial penalty is \Addanddrop, and the last day to
withdraw from the class, i.e., to request a {\ec W} grade is
prior to \Lastdropdate.  All requests for a W must be sent
to the registrar. \\

The final exam is scheduled for \Semesterfinalexam.\\

The following is a tentative schedule. The exam dates are
also noted on the schedule. These dates are subject to
change; this includes the exams.
