# Suggestions for ACT2020 organizers

* No more than 5 groups. 6 was definitely too many.

* Ensure diversity wrt gender, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, and field of expertise (esp. for the mentors)

* Definitely use ta's and have them selected by the
mentor. Suggest to the mentor to consider diversity when
making their pick.

* Seek funding as far in advance as possible

* For the online portion, set up a fixed meeting time at the
onset. Do not use weekly polls to set times.

* Be *very* clear when recruiting participation in
advertisements or whatever that industry participation is
welcome and encouraged

* Definitely invite Michael Johnson. Please ask me to
justify this.

* When selecting the participants, the organizers should
create a shortlist by themselves *then* ask the mentors for
their input. The more active voices there are, the slower
the decision process becomes.

* Try to create an application process, say through google
forms, that will feed you a single file per applicant.  No
matter how clearly you specify format requirements, people
will not follow your directions and will give you a handful
of files with all sorts of naming conventions. The only
exception to this is for a letter of recommendation, which
should be hidden from the applicant.

* Each group should have complementary backgrounds. We want
people from different background expertise to interact with
each other.

* Mix up locations for students, not too many from a single
place, e.g. we had too many from Oxford in 2019. Part of
the reason for that was likely self-selection: given that we
didn't have funding only participants who were sufficiently
local could commit to coming.

* When selecting students, weigh an average applicant who
seems invested in pursuing ACT in the future over an
excellent applicant who seems like this

* Motivation: get results AND build community (which
involves getting students before they start their pdh
research)

* Use a private github. Some people have the impulse to make
the reading forum public.  Don't give in. Keep it private.
Everyone should feel safe to ask ``dumb and naive'' questions and
propose ``dumb and naive'' ideas without them living on in
perpituity.

* Possible tutors: anne preller (linguistics),
