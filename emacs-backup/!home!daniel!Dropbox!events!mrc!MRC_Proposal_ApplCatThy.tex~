\section*{Scientific content}
% ====================================

Applied category theory is a new field of study focused on
the discovery and development of real-world applications of
category theory. Until recently, category theory has been
used as an abstract framework to relate structure underlying
collections of mathematical objects. It has been used by
algebraic geometers, homotopy theorists, and logicians. It
is rapidly becoming clear that the features of category
theory which make it suitable for this purpose also make it
an ideal framework with which to analyze systems of interest
across disparate applied contexts. During the
workshop, we intend to focus on three specific contexts in
which this realization occurs.

John Baez will lead students in studying \textbf{open gene
  regulatory networks}. A gene regulatory network is a
collection of molecules and reactions that govern the
expression of genes in a cell.  These are mathematically
modeled in a variety of ways, the simplest being a Boolean
network, where time proceeds in discrete steps and each node
is either ``on'' or ``off'' depending on whether its neighboring
nodes are on or off at the previous time step; Petri nets
give another, more detailed model.

Since gene regulatory networks are complex, they are
typically discovered in experiments one piece at a time.
These pieces are ``open'' gene regulatory networks, where
the expression of certain genes depends on inputs that are
not yet modeled as part of the network.  Researchers then
assemble these open networks into larger networks which
provide more detailed models.

Mathematically, the process of building larger open networks
from smaller ones is described by Fong's theory of decorated
cospans \cite{fongthesis}, or the newer formalism of
structured cospans developed by Courser \cite{courserthesis}
and expanded on by Cicala \cite{cicalathesis}. Using
research of Baez and Master \cite{baezmaster}, the biologist
Wu has recently used these ideas to model gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) as open Petri nets \cite{wu}. Baez's students will
construct and study a category whose morphisms are open GRNs.

Valeria de Paiva will lead students in investigating the
connections between the various manifestations of
\textbf{lenses}. The notion of a lens finds use in computer
science as a way to encode bidirectional transformations,
where one has a ``get'' function that connects an input to its
corresponding output, and a ``put'' function which updates
the input given an input-output pair. These two functions
must interact in sensible ways.

The abstract structure of lenses has been recently noticed
across surprisingly many applications of category theory,
such as in (but not limited to) the work of Fong, Spivak,
and Tuy\'{e}ras on a compositional model of backpropagation
in supervised learning \cite{backprop}, in the work of
Ghani, Hedges, et.~al.~ on compositional
economics \cite{compgames}, and in the work of Budiu,
Galenson, and Plotkin on \textbf{partial compilers}
\cite{partial}. An earlier context in which lenses come up
is in de Paiva's category theoretic investigation of
G\"{o}del's Dialectica interpretation, in which de Paiva
establishes a large part of the current knowledge of lenses
\cite{dialectica}.

In fact, one of the variants of the lenses discussed by both
\cite{backprop} and \cite{hedges} seems to be a certain
restriction of de Paiva's \textbf{Dialectica construction}, although
it is not immediately obvious to what degree such a
restriction preserves the logical structure of the
construction. It is also expected that there is a connection
between the Dialectica construction and the work on partial
compilers, but the details currently remain mysterious. De
Paiva's students will construct a framework which clarifies
in which precise sense the concept of lens as embodied by de
Paiva's Dialectica construction generalizes or modifies to
connect to the aforementioned work in applied categorical
contexts.

Nina Otter will lead students in studying the properties of
\textbf{social simplicial complexes}.  Networks have been
used to model social systems since the 1930s; in such models
nodes correspond to individuals or social positions, and
edges to pairwise connections between them. Such networks
are called \textbf{social networks}. One of the main
advantages of using networks to study social systems is that
they provide a more realistic model when studying dynamical
processes, such as the spread of a disease in a population
\cite{PV01}.

One of the main interests in social network science is the
study of social positions and roles. By ``position" social
scientists usually mean a collection of actors who have
similar ties to other actors, while a ``role" is a specific
pattern of ties among actors or positions. Since the 1970s a
lot of research has been done to develop these concepts in a
rigorous way. An open question was whether there is a way to
perform role and social position analysis simultaneously. In
\cite{OP19}, we answer this question in the affirmative, by
developing a categorical formulation of positional and role
analysis.

Often one is interested in modeling not only pairwise but
also higher order connections between individuals, and thus
simplicial complexes are a more appropriate model for social
systems \cite{CB18}.  Nina Otter's students will develop
position and role analyses for social simplicial complexes,
generalizing the work done in \cite{OP19}.

A recurring theme across these projects is that of a ``syntax-semantics correspondence''. That is, complicated systems may be regarded as an instance (or a ``semantics'') of an underlying logical structure (i.e. ``syntax''); and studying one part of a syntax-semantics correspondence often yields insight into the other. The study of such correspondences is quite classical, and is known as \emph{categorical semantics}. This aspect of category theory featured prominently during the \textbf{2017 MRC on Homotopy Type Theory}, in which organizers Cho and Cicala both participated: one of the projects of that MRC was to pin down more precisely how the syntax of type theory underlies homotopical models, within the framework of categorical semantics.

The projects described above for the 2020 MRC on Applied Category Theory seek to bring ideas of categorical semantics to bear in their respective contexts. That is, one may think of cospans as the syntax for open networks, specific instances of which are the semantics; lenses themselves are the syntax for surprisingly diverse kinds of semantics; and to categorically model social networks is exactly to identify the syntactic/logical structures underlying a social network.

%=================================
\section*{Objectives}
%=================================

Our objectives fall within three primary areas:
community building, mentorship, and developing category
theory as an interdisciplinary science.

Over the past several years, there has been a great effort
to build a community of applied category theory (ACT)
researchers, both in the US and abroad. The European ACT
community in particular is taking off quite rapidly,
building on its strong history of application in programming
languages and theoretical computer science, and more
recently in quantum computing. The proposed MRC would
contribute greatly to a similarly successful development of
a US-based ACT community. Such a development involves
increasing the interest in ACT by those currently outside
the field: due to the inherently interdisciplinary nature of
ACT, the dialogue between ACT researchers and those working
outside of category theory proper is particularly important
to the well-being and relevance of the ACT community. One
important component of invigorating dialogue overall is to
increase the participation of early career researchers,
especially from underrepresented groups, in the ACT
pipeline. We believe that this aligns perfectly with the
principles of the MRC program.

A crucial strategy to widen the pipeline into this field is by 
running programs that offer mentorship to early career 
researchers by senior career researchers. Mentorship 
contributes to several desired objectives, the first of which is 
to improve the general research skills of younger researchers. 
Another is to bolster the ability and confidence of young 
researchers to speak and write about research-level 
mathematics in the kinds of public forums (such as blogs or 
mailing lists) most commonly used by ACT researchers to 
communicate ideas. Empowering budding researchers to 
participate in these online forums will increase their visibility 
to the field at large. Lastly, because ACT is a young field, 
there are comparatively many exciting directions and open
problems for the relatively small size of the field. Mentorship 
can help energetic young researchers find the problems that 
they are suited for and passionate about.

Apart from the Applied Category Theory community,
there is also the subject itself.  We believe that category theory
can serve as an excellent medium in which to reason for a
wide host of application areas. The proposed MRC explores three such areas as laid out in the Scientific Content section. The objectives for each project are as follows.

Three objectives for Baez's project on applying category theory to regulatory gene networks are \textbf{(1)} build a category whose morphisms \emph{are} open GRNs and explore its structure (symmetric monoidal, hypergraph, etc.); \textbf{(2)} build large scale GRNs using smaller open regulatory gene networks; \textbf{(3)} formalize into category theory the variations of GRNs involving coupled differential equations, Boolean networks, and stochastic GRNs.  Two objectives for de Paiva's project on Dialectica categories are \textbf{(1)} continue the work of Brown and Gurr in \cite{browngurr} and de Paiva in \cite{depaivapetri} on using Dialectica categories of Petri nets to give a compositional theory of concurrent computation; \textbf{(2)} formalize the connection between Dialectica categories and partial compilers using a recently observed fact that both are a manifestation of abstract lenses \cite{partial, dialectica}.  Two objectives for Otter's project are \textbf{(1)} develop a model of social networks using simplicial complexes; \textbf{(2)} generalize position and role analysis from graphs to simplicial complexes.

\section*{Nuts and bolts}
%=================================

\subsection*{Prior to the week}

There are seven main working groups, each corresponding to
an objective of a project. Upon selection into the workshop,
each participant will be assigned to one working group by the
organizers, who will consider the participant's interest and background.

All participants will be expected to enter the workshop with
an understanding of category theory on the level of the text
\emph{Category Theory for Scientists} by David Spivak.  The
author has made the book freely available online, and so it
is accessible to all participants. The other reading
assignments depend on participants' working groups and are
from the relevant references listed in the Scientific
Content section of this proposal. To facilitate the
background reading for each participant, the organizers will setup a private online forum where participants can discuss the papers and organizers can ask leading questions to elicit responses.  This is modeled after the Kan Extension Seminar, an online reading course run by Emily Riehl \cite{riehlkan}.

This prior study will allow participants to begin research
immediately on Monday. Organizers will work closely with
participants prior to and during the research week to ensure
they have the requisite background.  In particular, the
organizers Baez, de Paiva, and Otter will lead their groups
towards achieving their objectives and the organizers Cho and Cicala will rotate between groups to answer participant questions, provide background knowledge, and otherwise support Baez, de Paiva, and Otter. 

\textbf{Monday.}  In the morning, Baez, de Paiva, and Otter will introduce the themes of the conference. After lunch, each organizer will lead a discussion with their associated groups to disseminate the research goals of the week. In the evening, Cho, Cicala, and Otter will lead the first professional development panel. 

\textbf{Tuesday.} 
The groups will work all day.

\textbf{Wednesday.}  The groups will work all morning.  In
the afternoon, all participants will reconvene to give
progress reports.  There will be several reports per working
group, one per sub-group, delivered by students. The
organizers will help the students prepare their reports and
give feedback afterwards. After completing the progress
reports, we will build in time for social activities such as
hiking.

\textbf{Thursday.} 
The groups will work all day. 

\textbf{Friday.}  The morning will be dedicated to
research. In the afternoon, the groups will give final
presentations, discuss future research directions, and make
plans to continue work on the most promising avenues. Again,
the presenters will be participants.

Interspersed with the mathematical activities will be a
variety of optional social activities—hikes, games, and the
like—so that everyone can clear their heads and get to know
each other a bit better.


\section*{Professional development}

We will enact three separate approaches to professional
development. 

First, on Monday evening we will hold a panel discussion led
by organizers Cho, Cicala, and Otter on the expectations of a job search.  All three underwent a job search in 2017-2018 and successfully found positions.  In addition, we will invite any participant who has recently completed a job search to join the panel.  Panelists will field questions from graduate students and speak to their experiences, including topics on preparing the research talks and teaching demonstrations, what questions to expect (for example, on recent trends in higher education such as the upcoming ``demographic cliff'' or ability to teach data science).

Second, we will hold a panel discussion on
Thursday evening, with panelists consisting of the senior
members of the community, e.g. Baez and de Paiva, and a moderator to guide the discussion. The questions will have been submitted
anonymously by the participants and communicated to the
panelists in advance by the moderator to allow adequate
preparation of answers. The panelists and moderators
themselves may also contribute questions to ensure that a
sufficiently broad range of relevant topics are
discussed. Baez can discuss the work of a tenured professor
and also what hiring committees look for in applicants. De Paiva can discuss working in industry.

In addition to the above panel discussion, we will organize
an ongoing flexible schedule of one-on-one meetings with
either senior or junior ``mentors'' drawn from both the
organizing committee (Baez and de Paiva) and the more senior
participants. Participants will have the opportunity to sign
up for 20-minute blocks of time with these mentors during
which they can ask mathematical or career questions in more
specificity than they otherwise might feel comfortable doing
in a panel setting. These blocks of time will be made
available throughout the workshop, with each mentor being
asked to offer a total of about two hours, distributed
according to what they consider reasonable.

The intent is not only that participants would feel more
comfortable in asking more specific questions, but also that
the mentors feel freer to give similarly specific---and thus
more helpful---answers. This has the added benefit of
helping the more senior members of the community stay aware
of the kinds of issues faced by the upcoming generation: as
applied category theory is rapidly evolving as both a
subject and a community, so are the issues that people often
face within it, and the experience of one generation may not
be representative of that of the next.


%=================================
\section*{Scale and participant recruitment}
%=================================

Applied Category Theory is a fast growing field as indicated
by the number of dedicated events all of which have only
begun within the past three years. Here, we present some of
these events.

An MRC in Applied Category Theory would be one in a growing
number of events dedicated to Applied Category Theory.  In
December 2019, a conference series called Symposium on
Compositional Structures (SYCO) will be hosting its sixth
event, each consisting of around twenty talks over two
days. The aim is to bring together researchers whose work
involves the principle of compositionality, a concept at the
core of what makes category theory an excellent domain to
reason about many applied problems.  SYCO's have been held
in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe.

An Applied Category Theory Conference and Adjoint School
just completed its second run.  This year, the conference
occurred at Oxford University where more than 40 talks were
given over the span of a week.  The speakers themselves 
embodied diversity along multiple major axes: they were a mix 
of senior and junior researchers hailing from both academia 
and industry, working on problems both pure and applied. 
Several of the talks detailed research that was spawned from 
the ACT2018 Adjoint School, which had received 80 
applications for 20 positions. (The 2019 Adjoint School 
received 130 applications for 24 positions.) With these past 
44 Adjoint School graduates and the many more excellent 
students for whom we had no room, we have a strong pool 
of potential participants in an MRC program. We should mention 
that the limited number of spaces for the Adjoint Schools meant 
that we were unable to admit postdocs, since the available 
positions were already completely filled by graduate students 
and industry professionals. While we expect that interest will 
again exceed availability, the larger scope of the MRC would 
allow for a broader inclusion of early career researchers.

There is also a strong online community of researchers
working on applied category theory.  This includes an
extremely influential mailing list for pure category theory
and a growing mailing list dedicated to applied category
theory.  In particular, one organizer of this event---John
Baez---has an large reach through his online presence.  He
runs the mathematics, physics, and climate change blog,
\emph{Azimuth} that attracts over 500 readers per day and
3.4 million views to date.  Baez also taught an online
course in the summer of 2018 on the textbook \emph{Seven
  Sketches in Compositionality} by Spivak and Fong, both
pioneers in applied category theory. This course had over
400 participants. There are also video resources on e.g.\ 
YouTube: the 2019 Seven Sketches in Compositionality 
lectures playlist alone has 13,500 views, and this is not to 
mention other well-frequented channels like the Catsters.

Applied category theory is also relevant to functional
programmers. Bartosz Milewski is instrumental in
disseminating this perspective through his popular blog,
\emph{Bartosz Milewski's Programming Cafe} which has over
1500 subscribers.  Milewski was a project leader at the
ACT2019 Adjoint School and central to our project of
bringing the category theory and programming communities
together.  He also maintains a popular YouTube channel on
the subject, boasting over 15,000 subscribers.

Finally and importantly, to bolster recruitment specifically from underrepresented groups, we plan to advertise this MRC through the Association of Women in Mathematics, Spectra (the Association for LGBTQ mathematicians), the National Association of Mathematicians (whose mission is to ``promote the mathematical development of all underrepresented minorities''), and the Society for Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science.
