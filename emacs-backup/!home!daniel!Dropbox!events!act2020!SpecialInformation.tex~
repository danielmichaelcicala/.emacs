\section*{Rationale for Performance Off-Campus}
\label{sec:rati-perf-camp}

The PI and coPI are instituted at the University of New
Haven, but the in-person research week will take place at
MIT. This is because the School is associated, though
independent of, the Applied Category Theory Conference which
is being organized by Brendan Fong and David Spivak of MIT.
