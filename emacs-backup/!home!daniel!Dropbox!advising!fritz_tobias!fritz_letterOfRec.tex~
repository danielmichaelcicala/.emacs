Re: Recommendation for Tobias Fritz \hfill
\today

\vspace{2em}
\noindent Dear Sir or Madame:
\vspace{1em}

The purpose of this letter is to recommend Dr.~Tobias Fritz, specifically
as an educator.  I have known Tobias for three years and
have always been impressed with his communication skills,
work ethic, and creativity. He would be a wonderful addition
to any department.

My primary experience with Tobias as an educator is through
his role in the Applied Category Theory Adjoint School 2019,
a non-traditional educational experience that I
co-organized.  Tobias was one of six ``mentors''. This means
that he led five students, a mix of mature undergraduate and
graduate students, to produce a piece of original research
on a project he designed. His project examined the
compositional structure of partial evaluation in terms of
monads and the bar construction.

The initial challenge that Tobias faced was to turn five
students into experts on specialized topics of category theory
and rewriting theory. Adding to this challenge is that his
students lived across North America and Europe, had
disparate mathematical backgrounds, and had only five months
to gain mastery of the necessary material.  He interacted
with his students via video chat, though email, and through
a file hosting platform called github. His students produced
two lectures on the material in their charge and two
excellent articles for the website The n-Category Caf\'{e}
that is popular amongst working category theorists. The
lectures and articles were high quality as judged on their own
merit and as compared with the output of other groups. Through
my interactions with Tobias and also with his students, I
determined that Tobias was central to his students' success.

In July 2019, the participants of the Adjoint School
convened for one week at the Department of Computer Science
in Oxford University to commence research. For five full
days, Tobias acted more as a facilitator and guru than
research lead. He instilled a high degree of motivation in
the students, as indicated by the long days they spent
working and the excitement with which they spoke of their
work.  In the end, the students produced original results
and additional, clear questions to orient future lines of
inquiry into their project.

Tobias put in a tremendous effort into the Adjoint School.
He was motivated, involved, and fully bought-in to our
mission.  He clearly cared deeply about his students and
their success.  I have no doubt that he will strengthen the
quality of teaching in your department.  In particular, if
you are looking to improve undergraduate or graduate
research, then he is an excellent candidate to do so.

In view of my experience, I recommend without reservation
that you hire Tobias Fritz. Please feel free to contact me
if you have any further questions.
