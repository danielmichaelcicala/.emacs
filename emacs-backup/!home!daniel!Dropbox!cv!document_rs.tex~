\section*{Research motivation}

Networks are used across many disciplines.  Chemists use
chemical reaction networks (Figure
\ref{fig:ResearchStatement_ChemicalRxNetwork}).
Neuroscientists use neural networks.  Computer scientists
use Petri nets (Figure
\ref{fig:ResearchStatement_PetriNet}), and biologists use
Markov processes.  Circuit diagrams, flow charts, and social
maps are networks.  Such tools are commonly used by
scientists, engineers, data analysts, sociologists, and by
decision makers in government and business.  They work quite
well to help us understand the objects they are designed to
study, but the tools themselves are less understood.  How do
they relate to each other?  What can knowledge about one
type of network tell us about another?

Networks are often modelled using a graph, sometimes equipped with
additional information. For example, the node of a chemical reaction
network corresponds to a chemical compound and each arrow is equipped
with the rate at which reactions occur. In other instances, such as in
the string-based languages developed for quantum mechanics
\cite{PicQuan}, we really want a homotopical, rather than
combinatorial, object.

To capture these various needs, I am interested in developing a
general theory of systems. My current work involves abstracting away
idiosyncrasies particular to any specific system.  Once carefully
abstracted away, one can unearth the characteristics essential to all
systems.

One impact of this work is that a general theory would be
trans-disciplinary. Having worked in silos for so long, researchers of
different stripes have developed their own languages, techniques, and
values. Breaking open these silos is a hurdle that $ 21^{\text{st}} $
century science must clear. A general theory of systems can play an
invaluable role in lifting us over this hurdle by allowing for
fruitful communication between fields. Certainly, there is much value
in bridging the gap between great thinkers in different fields.

\section*{Research interests}

\subsection*{Current research}

My research is motivated by developing a foundations for systems
theory using techniques primarily from category theory and logic.
While many domain specific theories already exist, the idea of
formulating a general theory is quite new. To this end, I have created
a formal syntax in which to reason about systems. Two central
features are that
\begin{itemize}
\item a relation to capture the ``sameness'' of systems is built-in,
  eliminating the need to import other theories such as first-order
  logic; and
\item the syntax is compositional.
\end{itemize}
The compositional viewpoint is that, to study a system, one should
decompose it in a way careful enough so that reconnecting the
components causes no emergent phenomenon.  Then one can study the
sub-systems to understand the original system.

Technical foundations for the syntax were laid out in my paper
\emph{Spans of Cospans} \cite{SpansCospans} and, together with Kenny
Courser, many desirable properties were shown in
\cite{CicalaCourser}.  In my forthcoming effort \cite{StrCsp}, I am
further refining the syntax and creating an ambient framework into
which this syntax sits. This allows for comparisons between different
systems. The main result of this latter paper is that, under suitable
conditions, reasoning locally about a system is equivalent to
reasoning globally.

To build my syntax, I begin with an adjunction between categories,
$ \mathsf{A} $ and $ \mathsf{X} $. A category is like an area of
mathematical discourse and an adjunction is a formal way to specify an
analogy between categories. The conceit is that the category
$\mathsf{A}$ contains the input and output types.  The category
$\mathsf{X}$ contains the system types. The adjunction allows us to
equip systems with inputs and outputs and then to connect compatible
systems together. This connectability is the medium through which we
build a system from sub-systems.

I have illustrated the use of this syntax with the ZX-calculus
\cite{zxCalc}, a string-based language used to simplify certain
computations typical in quantum computing. Because of this paper, I
was invited to present at the Quantum Physics and Logic conference.
This syntax has also been employed to study Petri Nets
\cite{OpenPetri}, Markov processes \cite{MarkProc}, and chemical
reaction networks \cite{ChemReac}.

I am currently working on using my syntax to introduce a compositional approach to
database theory. The development of such a theory
would have practical ramifications for data migration. What is more
interesting, however, is that this would put databases on the same
footing as the ZX-calculus thus allowing for a comparison of
phenomenon in databases and quantum computing.

\subsection*{Future directions}

In the future, I am mostly interested in social systems. Specifically,
I will work on using my syntax to develop a compositional approach to
social network analysis, agent-based modelling, and actor
networks. One advantage of my syntax is that it was constructed to
simplify the eventual study of semantics by way of \emph{functorial
  semantics}, invented by the great category theorist William Lawvere
\cite{FunctSeman}. Ultimately, I hope to work on formalizing social
systems.

Another direction I will pursue is to lift into my framework current
graph theoretical measures such as those covered in the text
\emph{Networks} by Mark Newman \cite{networks}.

Yet another direction was opened by my result in \cite{StrCsp} where I
proved that my syntax forms a topos. A topos is a sort of ``set-theory''.
This can be exploited to two ends. The first is to provide a
set-theoretical notation that can be easier to reason in than
categorical diagrams. The second is that, each topos has an associated
type theory describing the laws the ``sets'' follow. This allows us to
develop computer programs that model networks fitting into my
framework.
