\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

This proposal is for the funding of the Applied Category
Theory Adjoint School 2020. Participating in this School are
four groups, each comprising a leading expert, a TA of the
expert's choice, and four students selected by an open
application process. Each ground pursues a research project in
applied category theory designed by the leading expert.

The School has two components. The first component, for
which no funding is required, is a sixteen week long online
reading seminar. The TA's lead students through a reading
course designed to provide the background they will need to
engage in the research.  The reading seminar culminates in a
week long visit, for which funding is being requested, to
MIT where all participants conduct their research under the
direction of the leading expert.

The School is then followed by the Applied Category Theory
Conference, for which no funding is being requested.  This
conference is split into two components: research talks and
structured conversation around recent developments in the
field. Leading experts from industry and academia attend the
conference thus providing an opportunity for them and School
participants to work and socialize together. Also, time is
reserved for students to discuss their work from the School.

\subsection{Intellectual Merit}

Category theory has long been a powerful tool for
transferring techniques between disciplines in pure
mathematics. The rise of Applied Category Theory comes with
the usefulness of categorical methods in disciplines ranging
from biochemistry, electrical engineering and control theory
to the study of stochastic processes, the design of
databases, and the design of networks of mobile
agents. Operads, sheaves and other sophisticated concepts
are not only giving rise to new methodologies for system
design and analysis, but also triggering new developments in
the underlying mathematics. The School brings young minds
from diverse backgrounds to this emerging field to work on
research proposed by leading experts.

The School will see the pursuit of four research
projects. The first, led by Michael Shulman of the
University of San Diego, involves the development of a type
theory that corresponds to the kinds of categories
frequently used in applied category theory. The success of
this research would offer an improved ability for
programmers to implement categorical structure into
software. Such software can offer scientists and engineers
the benefits of applied category theory without having to
learn it.

Another project is led by Valeria de Paiva of Samsung
Research America. A strength of category theory is its
ability to illuminate abstract structure and find it in
disparate places. Recently, the concept of a lens has been
found to exist in many unexpected places. A lens, which
hails from database theory, is simply a pair of functions
that interact nicely.  However, when abstracted to it
essence, applied category theorists found this structure in
functional programming, backpropagation in machine learning,
and in game theory from economics.  Dr.~de Paiva's research
project will try to better understand lenses. Because lenses
are appearing is so many places, a better understanding of
lenses will lead to a better understanding of, for example,
machine learning and game theory.

\subsection{Broader Impacts}

The strongest broader impacts of this School are in
diversity and inclusion as well as a stronger relationship
between academia and industry.

Regarding diversity and inclusion, the School will be
advertised to potential students through, not only the
established networks in the applied category theory
community, but with the National Association of
Mathematicians, the Association for Women in Mathematics,
Spectra, the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and
Native Americans in the Sciences.  Applicants will be asked
to annonymously complete an optional survey to help organizers
ascertain the socio-economic makeup of the applicant
pool. After corollating the underserved applicants with
where they found the call for participation, subsequent
iterations of the School will put more resources into
advertising in those places which increase the diversity of
the applicant pool.

Regarding strengthening ties between academia and industry,
the applied category theory community is already well
represented in both areas. This strong relationship has been
cultivated because applied category theorists largely
believe that academia and industry are essential to the
success of applied category theory.  Currently, category
theory informs work at US companies includin Metron
Scientific Solutions, Pyrofex, and Categorical
Informatics. The four experts that are participating in the
School come from both academia and industry.  The School
intends to increase the strength of this relationship by
recruiting graduate students, post-docs, and industry
professionals by focusing on stregthening the networks. This
involves having people from both worlds work together. Also,
the Conference/Workshop attracts both industry professionals
and academics. The Conference/Workshop involves both
presentations and structured discussions to foster
interaction between industry and academics.  The
strengthening of networks is to be evaluated through
follow-up surveys.
