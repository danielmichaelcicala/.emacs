\textbf{Lecture 10---Derivative Rules}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Prior to derivatives, we focused on limits.  We did this by giving a fundamental definition of a limit then providing theorems that offered a higher level way to interact with limits.  This is analogous to computer software, which is a higher level way to interact with a computer where everything is grouded in 1's and 0's.  In math, everything is grounded in definitions.

The previous two lessons involved using the definition of a derivative to compute derivatives.  Here, we start to build the higher level ``software'', i.e.~theorems, that allow us to interact with derivatives in a way that's easier than the definition.
