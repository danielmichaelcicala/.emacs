\noindent {\LARGE \textsc{On diversity}}

\vspace{2em}

Increasing diversity is an important issue for me.  I do not
only view it as a way to help under-represented groups, but
as a way to strengthen the field of mathematics and our
culture as a whole.  Below are some ways in which I have
approached issues of diversity.

I have taught at three separate Hispanic serving
institutions, where a significant number of my students are
not full-time. They are parents, hold full-time jobs, and
have other family responsibilities. To increase their
ability to take part in my class, I promote flexibility. For
instance, if a student tells me they will miss class, I will
provide them with a hard copy of my lecture notes and allow
them to submit homework through email. This policy has
helped many students: one who watched their little brother
so their mother could go to work, another who watched their
child because their partner was unable to, and another who
needed to take an extra shift at work.  These are hard
working students whose life circumstance make it difficult
to follow typical classroom policies that favor
students without such responsibilities. Given this, I
continue to examine how my policies and processes
accommodate life circumstances of my students and allow them
to reach their full potential.

I am a middle class, straight white male. This informs how I
communicate.  My experience is different than many of the
students sitting before me. This will lead to
miscommunications. A relevant story that speaks volumes was
told by the only black doctor practicing at a certain
clinic. He was on a panel of, other than him, all white
doctors delivering a complicated prognosis to a black
patient who nodded along.  The white doctors did not see
they were not communicating well. The black doctor
recognized this and debriefed with the patient after the
others left, communicating the prognosis to the patient with
ease. The challenge here was one of communication style,
which is cultural. From this story, I take that there will
be miscommunication between me and my students to which I
will be blind. To minimize this, I use group work. I have
found that students are more vulnerable and ask more
questions to peers than to a professor, which is reasonable
consider the power dynamics involved. Group work opens the
opportunity for students to learn from a diverse set of
voices, where each student translates my messaging into
their own cognitive framework before dispersing it amongst
each other.

I also realize that fostering diversity must extend beyond
the classroom into other areas of academia.  For instance, I
am currently co-organizing a workshop for which we invited
six senior researchers.  When doing so, we considered
diversity in our invitations, and were successful in
securing a roster diverse in race, gender, and sexuality.
Given that mathematics is still dominated by white males, it
is especially important to provide fair opportunities to
benefit their career. This is true, not only for the good of
the people involved, but for mathematics as a field of
inquiry. For example, by having a diverse faculty, more
students will see someone at the head of the class that they
can relate to. This results in more students believing in
the viability of pursuing a career in mathematics. This
begets a stronger pool of mathematicians.  Also, it will
dilute the Euro-centric cultural values permeating
mathematics, broadening the scope of what is considered
valuable to the field which then allows more people to
contribute. In short, by increasing diversity in faculty
across academia will result in better mathematics.

As I continue to teach and perform research, I will embrace
my role in improving outcomes related to diversity.
